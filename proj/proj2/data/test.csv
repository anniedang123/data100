 CERT Advisory CA-2002-21 Vulnerability in PHP
 
    Original release date: July 22, 2002
    Last revised: --
    Source: CERT/CC
 
    A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.
 
 Systems Affected
 
      * Systems running PHP versions 4.2.0 or 4.2.1
 
 Overview
 
    A  vulnerability  has been discovered in PHP. This vulnerability could
    be  used  by  a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP
    and/or the web server.
 
 I. Description
 
    PHP  is  a  popular  scripting  language  in  widespread use. For more
    information about PHP, see
 
           http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.general.php
 
    The  vulnerability  occurs  in the portion of PHP code responsible for
    handling  file uploads, specifically multipart/form-data. By sending a
    specially  crafted  POST  request  to  the web server, an attacker can
    corrupt  the  internal  data  structures used by PHP. Specifically, an
    intruder  can  cause  an improperly initialized memory structure to be
    freed.  In  most  cases, an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or
    the  web  server. Under some circumstances, an intruder may be able to
    take  advantage  of  this  flaw  to  execute  arbitrary  code with the
    privileges of the web server.
 
    You  may  be  aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some
    implementations  of  malloc  and  free  does not usually result in the
    execution  of  arbitrary  code.  However, because PHP utilizes its own
    memory  management  system,  the  implementation of malloc and free is
    irrelevant to this problem.
 
    Stefan  Esser  of  e-matters  GmbH has indicated that intruders cannot
    execute   code   on   x86   systems.   However,  we  encourage  system
    administrators  to  apply  patches  on  x86  systems  as well to guard
    against denial-of-service attacks and as-yet-unknown attack techniques
    that may permit the execution of code on x86 architectures.
 
    This  vulnerability  was discovered by e-matters GmbH and is described
    in  detail  in  their  advisory.  The  PHP  Group  has  also issued an
    advisory.  A list of vendors contacted by the CERT/CC and their status
    regarding this vulnerability is available in VU#929115.
 
    Although   this  vulnerability  only  affects  PHP  4.2.0  and  4.2.1,
    e-matters  GmbH  has  previously  identified  vulnerabilities in older
    versions  of  PHP.  If  you  are  running  older  versions  of PHP, we
    encourage you to review
    http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012002.html
 
 II. Impact
 
    A  remote  attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
    An  attacker  may not be able to execute code on x86 architectures due
    to  the way the stack is structured. However, an attacker can leverage
    this  vulnerability  to  crash PHP and/or the web server running on an
    x86 architecture.
 
 III. Solution
 
 Apply a patch from your vendor
 
    Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.
    As  vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this
    section  and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular
    vendor  is  not  listed  below,  we  have not received their comments.
    Please contact your vendor directly.
 
 Upgrade to the latest version of PHP
 
    If  a  patch  is  not  available  from your vendor, upgrade to version
    4.2.2.
 
 Deny POST requests
 
    Until  patches  or an update can be applied, you may wish to deny POST
    requests.  The  following  workaround  is  taken from the PHP Security
    Advisory:
 
      If  the  PHP  applications on an affected web server do not rely on
      HTTP POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST
      requests on the web server.
 
      In  the  Apache  web server, for example, this is possible with the
      following  code  included  in  the  main  configuration  file  or a
      top-level .htaccess file:
 
      <Limit POST>
         Order deny,allow
         Deny from all
      </Limit>
 
      Note  that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have
      parameters contradicting the example given above.
 
 Disable vulnerable service
 
    Until  you  can upgrade or apply patches, you may wish to disable PHP.
    As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that
    are not explicitly required. Before deciding to disable PHP, carefully
    consider your service requirements.
 
 Appendix A. - Vendor Information
 
    This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this
    advisory.  As  vendors  report new information to the CERT/CC, we will
    update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a
    particular  vendor  is  not  listed  below, we have not received their
    comments.
 
 Apple Computer Inc.
 
           Mac  OS  X  and  Mac  OS X Server are shipping with PHP version
           4.1.2  which  does  not  contain the vulnerability described in
           this alert.
 
 Caldera
 
           Caldera  OpenLinux  does  not provide either vulnerable version
           (4.2.0,  4.2.1)  of  PHP  in their products. Therefore, Caldera
           products are not vulnerable to this issue.
 
 Compaq Computer Corporation
 
           SOURCE:  Compaq Computer Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary
           of  Hewlett-Packard  Company  and  Hewlett-Packard  Company  HP
           Services Software Security Response Team
           x-ref: SSRT2300 php post requests
           At  the  time  of  writing  this  document, Compaq is currently
           investigating   the   potential  impact  to  Compaq's  released
           Operating System software products.
           As  further  information  becomes available Compaq will provide
           notice  of  the  availability  of any necessary patches through
           standard  security bulletin announcements and be available from
           your normal HP Services supportchannel.
 
 Cray Inc.
 
           Cray, Inc. does not supply PHP on any of its systems.
 
 Debian
 
           Debian GNU/Linux stable aka 3.0 is not vulnerable.
           Debian GNU/Linux testing is not vulnerable.
           Debian GNU/Linux unstable is vulnerable.
           The  problem  effects PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1. Woody ships
           an  older  version  of  PHP  (4.1.2),  that doesn't contain the
           vulnerable function.
 
 FreeBSD
 
           FreeBSD  does not include any version of PHP by default, and so
           is  not  vulnerable; however, the FreeBSD Ports Collection does
           contain  the  PHP4  package. Updates to the PHP4 package are in
           progress  and a corrected package will be available in the near
           future.
 
 Guardian Digital
 
           Guardian  Digital  has not shipped PHP 4.2.x in any versions of
           EnGarde, therefore we are not believed to be vulnerable at this
           time.
 
 Hewlett-Packard Company
 
           SOURCE:  Hewlett-Packard Company Security Response Team
           At  the  time  of  writing  this  document,  Hewlett Packard is
           currently  investigating  the potential impact to HP's released
           Operating System software products.
           As further information becomes available HP will provide notice
           of  the  availability of any necessary patches through standard
           security  bulletin  announcements  and  be  available from your
           normal HP Services support channel.
 
 IBM
 
           IBM  is  not vulnerable to the above vulnerabilities in PHP. We
           do  supply the PHP packages for AIX through the AIX Toolbox for
           Linux  Applications.  However,  these packages are at 4.0.6 and
           also incorporate the security patch from 2/27/2002.
 
 Mandrakesoft
 
           Mandrake Linux does not ship with PHP version 4.2.x and as such
           is  not  vulnerable.  The  Mandrake Linux cooker does currently
           contain  PHP  4.2.1  and  will  be  updated shortly, but cooker
           should  not be used in a production environment and no advisory
           will be issued.
 
 Microsoft Corporation
 
           Microsoft  products  are not affected by the issues detailed in
           this advisory.
 
 Network Appliance
 
           No Netapp products are vulnerable to this.
 
 Red Hat Inc.
 
           None  of  our commercial releases ship with vulnerable versions
           of PHP (4.2.0, 4.2.1).
 
 SuSE Inc.
 
           SuSE Linux is not vulnerable to this problem, as we do not ship
           PHP 4.2.x.

 spamc will skip every file bigger than 250k on it's own. It's got the 
 command line switch -s to change this value. But it doesn't hurt of course 
 to use the procmail limit.

 or, alternatively, giveaway patterns in the HTML?  That's what's happening
 with most obfuscating techniques the spammers are trying -- they become
 a very reliable sign of spam in themselves!

  But the PROMs are for specific network cards, and all their are really is
 a bootp/tftp client. Not the whole set of nice bits & pieces you get with
 an OpenBoot PROM.
 
  AMD were talking of supporting it ages back, when the Athlon was looking
 like it would just be on workstations from day one. They seemed to drop
 it, and go for the crappy MSDOS compatible BIOS though.

 Still worthwhile -- 1.257% is not that bad.  :-)
 
 My results:
 
   OVERALL%   SPAM% NONSPAM%     S/O    RANK   SCORE  NAME
     11774     4079     7695    0.35    0.00    0.00  (all messages)
   100.000   34.644   65.356    0.35    0.00    0.00  (all messages as %)
     0.195    0.564    0.000    1.00    0.75    1.00  T_ROT13_EMAIL_3
     0.161    0.466    0.000    1.00    0.73    1.00  T_ROT13_EMAIL_2
     0.161    0.466    0.000    1.00    0.73    1.00  T_ROT13_EMAIL
 
 The interesting thing is that these hits all seem to be rot13 versions
 of the To: address.  If we ever start getting FPs (or if anyone is
 worried), we could make it an eval test for rot13 of the To: address
 (turning non-word characters into ""."" characters in the regular
 expression).
 
 At the same time, it might be worth testing for username in HTML
 comments.  I found some <!--quinlan--> types in HTML comments, but I
 haven't seen enough hits so far to bother (however, I did add a really
 good test for email addresses in comments).

","
 No I was just a little confused because I'm running procmail on a gateway
 and sits between the external sendmail box and internal exchange bridgehead
 server.  So there isn't any delivery to the local system.
 
 The only email it gets is inbound at the moment and we're looking to get rid
 of complication and go back to two boxes.  I did a test which looked like
 you guys are right about procmail, but testing is very limited due to the
 config I currently have.  It's just confusing when set up as a gateway.

 Using procmail, SpamAssassin doesn't get called for outgoing email
 (messages sent to other machines). 
 Procmail=Local Delivery Agent => inbound traffic to LOCAL machine.

14,"Subject: Keillor voices up on what to do with the WTC site
","
 http://www.phc.mpr.org/posthost/index.shtml
 
 Dear Garrison,
 
 There are at least six plans about what to do with
 ""Ground Zero"" in New York. I believe a suitable memorial
 surrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,
 children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such
 as a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works
 would be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.
 What do you think should done with the space?
 
 Joe Adams
 Hillsdale, New Jersey
 
 I dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan
 that's designed by committee and that's gone through
 public hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold
 and ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more
 public space that the public hates, of which there are
 plenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city
 and that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young
 ambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the
 towers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic
 events occurred in New York that in any other city would
 be commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and
 historical museums and in New York there's barely a
 little plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.
 It's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for
 their big chance, and compared to that spirit of
 entrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a
 statue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's
 Tomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President
 Grant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb
 and think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all
 the things that New York is about. If you want to find
 Grant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New
 York: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial
 city. New York is for the young and lively.

 Bob,
 
 This capacitor drive idea isn't completely stupid, but neither is it well
 thought out.
 
 Maxwell (www.maxwell.com) makes and sells high energy density capacitors,
 called ultracapacitors.  They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage
 regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly
 the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16
 kilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic
 energy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in
 a vacuum.
 
 Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8
 kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much does
 the 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet
 it isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph --
 the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored
 electrically in the capacitor.  And it's not at all obvious that the torque
 vs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do
 it without wheels, drive train, etc.
 
 But if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag!
 
 On to the Lunarnationals?  Or would you prefer the bite of donut?

16,"Subject: I could be JAILED for selling this CD!
","Dear fellow eBay user,
 
 I listed this CD on eBay a few months ago and here's 
 what happened.  I got an email from Safeharbor saying 
 that all my auctions had been cancelled and that the CD 
 was permanently ""banned"" from being sold on eBay.  From 
 then on, I called it the ""Banned CD""!
 
 So why did eBay ban it?  Maybe they figured you shouldn't 
 have access to this type of information, or maybe they 
 didn't think we could cram all of these programs onto 
 one CD Rom.  I'll let you decide.
 
 This CD will teach you things that eBay, Uncle Sam, and 
 others just don't want you to know.  I am not responsible 
 for how you use some of this information and it is 
 provided for educational purposes only.  Here are just a 
 few of the things you will learn ...

     trouble obtaining much of this information.  You 
     will have all the resources of any professional 
     investigator right at your fingertips - on your

     vision goggles, passports, fake identification, and 
     everything else that you won't find in the back of 
     Soldier of Fortune magazine!
 
 *** Find products to resell on the Internet with our 
     Wholesale Directory containing over 1 million 
     (that's right, one million!) wholesale sources for

 Yeah, you could always run away, strangle your wife, your wife could
 always poison you, scooby dooby doo. It wasn't the rule, and I don't feel 
 like desintegrating into a nitpicking orgy. You win.

 Yeah, I happen to live in a small hole, under the roots of an old oak 
 tree. You don't, so innovation is a global phenomenon.

 So thought I, but apparently all it favours is a lot of whining about good
 old times, the inability of youngn's to pay for your pension and the
 health insurance, and the generic influx of uncouth furriners, which must 
 be stopped, Somehow.

 I don't think I've tried yet, but if I did, I probably moved on to another
 package after having bumped into one of the problems you mention.
 
 If anyone sends me a patch to my spec file and eventually needed patches
 etc., I'd be more than glad to make a new build available.

 For a long time I have used an external editor with exmh (gvim).
 
 I can cut'n'paste from exmh's message display window into spawned
 gvim processes, but not into anything else.
 
 This is VERY annoying.
 
   (I have to look at the message with cat or less or whatever in a
   terminal window if I want to do this - which is quite often.  And
   if the message is q-p encoded or a non-text/plain mime type, I end
   up with all that raw garbage too).
 
 Anyway to fix this?
 
 (BTW: standard i386 redhat7.3)
 
 Thanks.

 I just wanted to second what Stephen says, from an independent
 perspective:  The few times I've encountered an obstacle installing
 current Linux distributions on Dell boxes, it's been because Dell were
 an early adopter of (e.g.) a new Adaptec SCSI chipset, which hadn't 
 been included in all installation kernels.  And that is the risk you
 _always_ take when you blindly buy hardware systems for Linux without
 verifying chipset support, first.  If anything, Dell have over the years
 occasioned less such trouble than have many competitors, in this area.

 When I'd read that ""getting legal title
 can take 20 years"", when I believe that
 1 year ought to be more than sufficient,
 (and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd
 assumed that we were talking about the
 urban poor.
 
 If I see people living in mansions, or
 even in suburban subdivisions, I assume
 they didn't have too much trouble with
 their titles.
 
 If I see people living in shanties and
 haphazard alleyways, I tend to assume
 their parcels weren't exactly recorded
 on the government maps, or paid for with
 a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant
 lots have shotgun wielding men presumably
 intent on keeping them ""development"" free.
 
 Now, it may be that ""Manhattanites' view
 of America"" to say that outside of Metro
 Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or
 two (Cebu?), everything else (literally)
 is the boondocks.  But going on that very
 broad assumption, I guess I'm describing
 the flip side of Mr. Roger's experience:
 the paisanos (who leave behind those who
 remain on a patron's rural land) move to
 Manila, and (the second assumption) squat
 in shantytowns there, at least until they
 can line up a middle-class job.
 
 So, going on two large assumptions, I can
 come up with a scenario under which title
 would take 20 years: a shantytown arises
 somewhere in the midst of a section (or
 whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the
 land) and it takes decades of arguing to
 put together a package which somehow can
 both compensate the owner and record lots
 for the inhabitants.  Just transferring
 title to an existing lot, between parties
 who have money, ought not to be a problem.
 
 The obvious solution, at least to us
 barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is
 to ""introduce market mechanisms"".  It is
 left as an exercise to come up with one
 which works when many of the agents (are
 perceived to) have negligible NPV.

 What happened to more highly-capitalized

 sounds like it might sidestep that.

33,"Subject: Request For Transfer Assistance
","FROM: DR. BEN KOKORI
 
 Compliments of the season.  I would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as Contained in this letter.  Before going into details of my proposal to you, I must first implore you to treat with the utmost confidentiality, as this is required for its success. 
 
 My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of Nigerias Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria. 
 
 In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 2002. The source of the funds is as follows: During the last military regime in Nigeria, government Officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals. The present civilian government set up the contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants !
 and members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred thousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this letter.
 We have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows;  (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for us (the panel officials   (iii)10% to be used in settling all expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the actualization of this project.
 
 We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk-free. We
 Intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated above_-:Your Bank's name, Companys name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the account number into which  the funds should be paid. The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. This way, we will use your companys name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract to your company. We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. 
 Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my direct Telephone number 234 1775 5791 and my America Internet Fax number 240 744 0416 or 801 516 7986 only.
 It was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality. I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when I hear from you.
 
 Best regards,
 
 BEN KOKORI

41,"Subject: [ILUG] PPPD disconnects on me!
","Hello folks!
 I'm new to Linux, so here goes...
 I've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem.
 I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18.
 I've got this Win-Modem(yes, I know) and managed to locate a proper driver
 for it.
 Minicom is very much able to dial out.
 But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation.
 When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all I get (after the initial info
 of my dynamic IP, etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal.
 Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat.
 I used this command:  pppd call Provider (where Provider is some script
 somewhere).
 It dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connection
 is established, it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits.
 This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serial
 port using pppd to connect ttyS0.  I ran pppd waiting for a connection, me
 friend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited.
 
 Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of
 having to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to
 Linux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc.  It'd be nice never have
 to go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).
 
 Thanks a million.

 The procmail bug happens when the filter program does something that 
 procmail doesn't expect.  Exactly what that something is, hasn't been
 confirmed by anyone on the procmail list.  It might be exiting with a
 nonzero status, or it might be producing output on the standard error,
 or it might be something else entirely.
 
 So Simon is attempting to get SA to run flawlessly, because then it can't
 tickle the procmail bug.  This isn't a fix, it's a band-aid, but because
 he apparently doesn't have the option of installing a newer procmail ...

 Robert Harley:

 Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations.
 But that obscures the different modes of
 promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for
 money or power or companionship and the person
 who uses money and power and companionship to
 get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense
 of the word. But their motives and behavior are
 quite different.
 
 Langur monkeys were the example in the cited
 article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that
 are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey
 .. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But
 cozying up to the current dominant male isn't
 the best strategy for female langurs, because
 ""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every
 27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many
 extra-group males as possible, female langurs
 ensure their offspring against infanticide,""
 by the male who is likely next to rule the
 roost.
 
 Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a
 picture of carefree females engaged in joyously
 promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who
 is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a
 better picture of that. ;-)

 Ever tried to get MH to *not* have a 'pseq' sequence?  I suspect everybody's
 looking at a big box that has unseen and pseq in it.  Might want to add
 'pseq' to the 'hide by default' list....

 Ok
 
 Well I am having fun with ADSL now at the moment. I had gotten the
 full package from eircom and elected to take the Zytel Prestige 645M
 (that M is very important) But alas I cannot get it to work even with
 another Major and popular graphical OS. So after almost 8 hours onto
 adsl support trying to conince them that they did actually supplu and
 support the 645M and not just the 643 and 645R its still not working.
 So, after all that I am going to try a poweredge to connect and if
 all else fails I will wait till Eircom send me out a replacement ( I
 am going to have to look for the Alcatel this time :-) But while I
 was doing my googleing I came acroos this
 
 http://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe/how-to-connect.txt
 http://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe/
 
 And they look very cool for the beginner. Also the is a cool article
 on www.linux.ie about USB and ADSL with PPPoE on Linux. ANyhow when I
 do get it working (either with the 645 MMMMM or something else) I
 will put up a howto but really the above is quite cool.

 So Eugen, how many of your homo friends have -had- 3k lovers?
 
 In fact, thats a general question for FoRK proper.
 
 Do you know anyone, outside of meybee Wilt Chamberlin and a few of the
 gang-bang porn queens who -have- had even 1.5k lovers?
 
 Eegads, if you're hypothesizing numbers like -that- Eugen, you at
 least owe it to FoRK to back that shit up.
 
 Otherwise we're liable to assume rampant unfounded homophobia and that
 would just be a lose.
 
 Just a quick assumption here.   I'm not a math geek or anything, but
 assuming 1 lover every day, that would be like at least one lover
 everyday for 8 years and some change.   I don't know about you, but
 very very few of us are -that- lucky (or even close to that lucky)
 and after awhile, even the sexaholics get bored and have to mingle
 something new into their weekends.   You really are assumiing that the
 homosexual population is a) that large in a given area (The meccas
 might qualify, but try finding that kind of homosexual population in
 say, Tulsa, Oklahoma or Manchester, NH (Tho Manchester does have quite
 a few nifty gaybars, but thats a different story)  b) that bored/sex
 obsessed/recreationally free to pursue sex that often, with that many
 partners or that they'd even WANT that many partners.
 
 Qualify yourself, or at least lower your outrageous numbers.

 But RAM is expensive, and the directory structures of many systems (e.g.
 Windows) are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this
 combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical. Even if you are
 fortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you
 still can't fit a lot on a CD. Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of
 static multimedia content on the web server. This particular problem can be
 alleviated somewhat by using DVDs, but this is a temporary solution at best
 which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard
 drives become cheaper.

 Right. This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-term
 significance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put static
 application code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most large
 client/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, because
 these are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different
 sets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People also
 tend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular
 with the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistence
 services at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to a
 physical architecture that has a static web server, a static application
 server, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions. (I
 use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable
 because the ""unchangeable"" partitions might be written to for temporary swap
 space. Who knows what Windows does internally?)
 
 My point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAID
 device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image
 partition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but
 solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of
 base images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the
 server is rebooted. If some vendor wished to implement this, they could then
 market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that
 rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer
 overflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorized
 modification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this
 particular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defend
 application data. But those techniques all assume that your system itself
 has not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could
 help.
 
 I would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a
 hardware RAID vendor to implement. (I'm just guessing, of course, with no
 knowledge of how hardware RAID works internally.) If anyone knows of such a
 product, I'd love to hear about it.

 This is my true experiance. Six months back my shoe company was going bankrupt in a time of one month. I have no where to turn to. Luckily I met this guy Michael at www.blessing-people.com This is a non-profit web site. He really saved me. He started to chant for mine business without asking for any money when I told him my story. In just 10 days my business turn around. At the end of the month I could pay my monthly loan instalment. Thing steadily stabilized. Immediately I subscribe to his chanting servies. Those money Michael collected are for donation later in every year. I know I must have been creating good karma by subscribing to his prayers services. Now I am hunting for my second shop. Thanks to Michael.
 
 I do not have any connection to him. I am just spreading this good karma just to repay what he had did for me. I deeply know what ever he did it's a miracle to me. Even until today all I know was Michael chant for me & many people.. And many miracle happened.

 ) In tweaking my system to try to optimize the use of razor (this now from a network/connection/etc standpoint, not so much from a philosphical stance on what is or is not considered spam and who should decide it) I have come across a couple issues that I hope I may be able to get some relief on ...
 ) 
 ) 1) What *exactly* does ""Unable to connect to honor.cloudmark.com:2703; Reason: Operation now in progress."" mean ??? I have seen this error message some 1700 times today (between 2 clustered servers) representing a little over 1% failure rate. In an enterprise level I was hoping for more along the lines of maybe one-tenth that .....
 
   It's a network error - That string is not created by 
   Razor Agents.  Its trying to connect and having trouble.  
   1700 times seems abnormally high.  How many successful
   connections were there in the same timespan?
 
 
 ) 2) Related somewhat to question 1: is there (or will there be if currently not) a way of adjusting the timeout the setting for the razor-check to await a response from the server it queries? I am running this as a sendmail milter and adjusting the milter timeouts won't help if the razor-check script times out first anyway ....
 
   The timeout is hardcoded to 15 secs.  
   No plans right now to make that an option.
   You can always edit the source - Core.pm.  :)
 
 
 ) 3) What are the plans for fire.cloudmark, apt.cloudmark, ubik.cloudmark?  It seems that we have all these catalogue servers yet a good portion of the time, only one is available or the last discovery ends up only listing one (currently honor.cloudmark) in the cataloge.lst file.
 
   The system is designed so servers can be added and 
   subtracted without the clients caring - if the razor
   client can't connect to a server, it re-discovers, getting
   all currently available servers and stores results locally.
 
 
 ) 4) What would be the implications/requirements/caveats of hosting a catalogue server or, at the minimum, a caching server (similar to the way mail-abuse.org, for example, does dns zone transfers of its rbl list -- I realize that this is a completely different mechanism, but you get the point I am driving at here). I realize that there is an issue of polluting the catalogue but perhpas there could be some way of certifying a catalogue server? What type of bandwidth considerations are we looking at here? (It is just the signatures that are actually transferred across the pipes, is it not?)
 
   We are looking into releasing caching catalogue servers 
   for those besides us to use.
 
 
 ) It really looks like there is a great potential here for a very workable tool and if I can get some of these issues addressed or can even be of some assistance, all the better .....

 Clearly you've never met ""Triumph"", the Fabulous Crotch-Sniffing
 Caymanian Customs Wonder Dog at extreme close range, or heard the
 story about the expat's college age kid, actually born on Cayman, who
 was literally exiled from the island when the island constabulary
 ""discovered"" a marijuana seed or three in his summer-break rental car
 a few years back.
 
 I mean, his old man was some senior cheese at Global Crossing at the
 time, but this was back when they could do no wrong. If that's what
 they did to *his* kid, imagine what some poor former
 junk-bond-hustler might have to deal with someday for, say, the odd
 unauthorized Cuban nightlife excursion. A discretely folded twenty
 keeps the stamp off your passport on the ground in Havana, and a
 bottle of Maker's Mark goes a long way towards some interesting
 nocturnal diversion when you get there and all, but still, you can't
 help thinking that Uncle's going to come a-knockin', and that Cayman
 van's going to stop rockin' some day, and when it does, it ain't
 gonna be pretty.
 
 
 Closer to home, conceptually at least, a couple of cryptogeeken were
 hustled off and strip-searched, on the spot, when they landed on
 Grand Cayman for the Financial Cryptography conference there a couple
 of years ago. Like lots of cypherpunks, these guys were active
 shooters in the Bay Area, and they had stopped in Jamaica, Mon, for a
 few days on the way to Grand Cayman. Because they, and their stuff,
 reeked on both counts, they were given complementary colorectal
 examinations and an entertaining game of 20 questions, or two,
 courtesy of the Caymanian Federales, after the obligatory fun and
 games with a then-snarling Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Wonder Dog.
 Heck, I had to completely unpack *all* my stuff for a nice, well-fed
 Caymanian customs lady just to get *out* of the country when I left.
 
 
 Besides, tax havens are being increasingly constrained as to their
 activities these days, because they cost the larger nation-states too
 much in the way of ""escaped"" ""revenue"", or at least the perception of
 same in the local ""free"" press. Obviously, if your money ""there""
 isn't exchangeable into your money ""here"", it kind of defeats the
 purpose of keeping your money ""there"" in the first place, giving
 folks like FinCEN lots of leverage when financial treaties come up
 for renegotiation due to changes in technology, like on-line
 credit-card and securities clearing, or the odd governmental or
 quango re-org, like they are wont to do increasingly in the EU, and
 the US.
 
 As a result, the veil of secrecy went in Switzerland quite a while
 ago. The recent holocaust deposit thing was just the bride and groom
 on that particular wedding-cake, and, as goes Switzerland, so goes
 Luxembourg, and of course Lichtenstein, which itself is usually
 accessible only through Switzerland. Finally, of course, the Caymans
 themselves will cough up depositor lists whenever Uncle comes calling
 about one thing or another on an increasingly longer list of fishing
 pretexts.
 
 At this point, the ""legal"", state-backed pecuniary privacy pickings
 are kind of thin on the ground. I mean, I'm not sure I'd like to keep
 my money in, say, Vanuatu. Would you? Remember, this is a place where
 a bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will
 close it down until the local erst-cannibal hunter-gatherer turned
 statutorily-permanent landowner figures out just what his new or
 imagined property rights are this afternoon.
 
 
 The point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only
 solution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private
 transactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than ""transparent""
 transactions currently are in meatspace. Then things get *real*
 interesting, and financial privacy -- and considerably more personal
 freedom -- will just be the icing on the wedding cake. Bride and
 groom action figures sold separately, of course.
 
 Cheers,
 RAH
 (Who went to FC2K at the Grand Cayman Marriott in February that year.
 Nice place, I liked Anguilla better though, at least at the time, and
 I haven't been back to either since. The beaches are certainly better
 in Anguilla, and the ""private"" banking system there is probably just
 as porous as Cayman's is, by this point. If I were to pick up and
 move Somewhere Free outside Your Friendly Neighborhood Unipolar
 Superpower, New Zealand is somewhere near the top of my list, and
 Chile would be next, though things change quickly out there in
 ballistic-missile flyover country. In that vein, who knows, maybe
 we're in for some kind of latter-day Peloponnesian irony, and
 *Russia* will end up the freest place on earth someday. Stranger
 things have happened in the last couple of decades, yes?)

 Well, I think my avifile build still needs the win32 codecs to be able to
 run (manually copied into /usr/lib/win32/), but personally, I've been very
 happy with mplayer's default (which is ffmpeg's ffdivx decoder) for nearly
 all the DivX files I used. The only ones that still require (from my own
 experience) the use of the win32 codecs are the ones encoded with a strange
 DivX 3 sound format... and I've really not seen any quality or speed
 improvements when using them.

 Ie if you are getting a little orange LED when you plug it in then your PSU

 Antimissile defense is designed to operate in ~LEO environment, and knocks
 out stuff by kinetic kill or nearby nuking (damage by neutron flux
 impacting the fissibles). It is *not* designed to apply a 100 MT warhead
 (we don't have these, and synchonous impact is even more out of question)  
 detonate-on-impact to a 28 km/s rock or rubble target. A 100 MT warhead
 most assuredly will scarcely fragment a 2 km target in the few seconds
 left before the impact. This is so obvious it doesn't even to need to be
 modeled.

 The anti-missile defense is about worse than useless in this case. The
 only way to protect is determining orbits at high precision and deflecting
 long-term. Decades for targets this size.

 Can you submit this to bugzilla?  It definately is a bug, I mean I do
 a packet trace and here's what I get with one of my spams:
 
 [the request]
 
 0040  0b 8e 43 48 45 43 4b 20 53 50 41 4d 43 2f 31 2e   ..CHECK SPAMC/1.

 [the spam, removed for brevity]
 
 [the response]
 
 0040  0b 8f 53 50 41 4d 44 2f 31 2e 31 20 30 20 45 58   ..SPAMD/1.1 0 EX

 0060  20 3b 20 34 36 2e 35 20 2f 20 35 2e 30 0d 0a 0d    ; 46.5 / 5.0...
 
 
 So spamd is definately returning false incorrectly.

 A solution could be the preprocessor in combination with PM_FILTER -- if we

 It seems the older Perl gets, the more willing people are to believe that
 it sucks, without any reasonable facts. [0]davorg writes ""You may have
 seen the article [1]Can Java technology beat Perl on its home turf with
 pattern matching in large files? that there has been some debate about on
 both #perl and comp.lang.perl.misc today. One of the biggest criticisms

 is comparing his Java with.""

 This was not a very busy week, with people packing for YAPC::Europe, and
 all that... Nevertheless, the smoke tests were running, the bug reports
 were flying, and an appropriate amount of patches were sent. Read about
 printf formats, serialized tied thingies, built-in leak testing, syntax
 oddities, et alii.

 fwiw, I can't reproduce this with
 
   spamd --debug --auto-whitelist --allowed-ips=""127.0.0.1""
   spamd --debug --auto-whitelist --allowed-ips=""127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.1""
   spamd --debug --auto-whitelist --allowed-ips=""192.168.1.1, 127.0.0.1""
 
 which I presume is what you meant (except for the missing args
 of course).  They all seem to work OK.

 Well, shiver me timbers, but my favorite pirate phrase is missing from 
 both of those.Arrr....
 and wondering if there's a rap equivalent.

 *Q AND A SECTION*
 
 *SHIVER MY TIMBERS*
 
 /From Tad Spencer/: ""Please could you tell me where the phrase /shiver 
 my timbers/ originated?""
 
 This is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be 
 better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any 
 actual sailors' usage.
 
 It's an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or 
 other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver, or shake, so implying a 
 calamity has occurred. It is first recorded as being used by Captain 
 Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: ""I won't thrash you Tom. 
 Shiver my timbers if I do"".
 
 It has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years 
 later Robert Louis Stevenson found it to be just the kind of old-salt 
 saying that fitted the character of Long John Silver in /Treasure 
 Island/: ""Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before 
 you ... some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, 
 and all to feed the fishes"". Since then, it's mainly been the preserve 
 of second-rate seafaring yarns.

            Summary: Split up FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS
            Product: Spamassassin
            Version: unspecified
           Platform: Other
         OS/Version: other
             Status: NEW

           Priority: P2
          Component: Rules
         AssignedTo: spamassassin-devel@example.sourceforge.net
         ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com
 
 
 The current FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS triggers on any from where the user name ends
 in two or more digits.  I think this should be split up into different
 numbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can
 get different scores.  So I've made test rules that look from From
 names that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or
 more digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a
 single digit, just the sake of completeness.
 
 Here is what I got:

   8.847    6.817    9.791    0.41    0.22    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS1
 
 I should note that I get rather bad S/O's for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS, probably
 because so much of my corpus is made up of Yahoo! Groups traffic, which
 seems to have a lot of users that like sticking numbers at the ends of their
 names.  Here is the normal stats for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS:
 
   7.024   28.480    2.834    0.91    0.50    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS
 
 and my stats:
 
  19.228   34.793   11.991    0.74    0.35    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS

 An old laptop would probably be ideal.  That way, it comes with its own

 Most spammers don't check reply codes at all, they just send out as many
 mails as their system will hold without checking for any confirmation.
 
 A trick to lower spam reception was dicussed on the postfix mailing list
 some time ago: answer all incoming mail with a 4xx temporary error code when
 it is offered the first time, and accept it the second time. Apparently most
 mass-emailers don't even try to deliver a second time.

 BROTHER, CAN YOU SPARE A JET?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 Creditors and shareholders of U.S. Airways found themselves in
 the upright and locked position Sunday as the nation's
 sixth-largest airline filed for bankruptcy protection.
 
 The Arlington, Va.-based carrier sought cover under the
 bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, but much of its trouble could be
 traced to Sept. 11. Remember when all U.S. airports reopened
 except for Reagan Washington, which was too close to the White
 House and other gov sites? Remember how it was weeks before the
 first lonely flights lifted at last? Guess which airline was the 
 major carrier there. (Hint: It's the same one that bled $2
 billion in the past year.)
 
 Even before the terror attacks, U.S. Airways was an animal in
 pain. To all the usual industry troubles, add these: fierce
 competition from discounters, a too-small area of service
 concentrated on the East Coast, and an unofficial battle with
 United Airlines for the highest labor costs in the business.
 Frustrated, the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years
 ago, reminded the Washington Post. In a bid to get bought by
 United, U.S. Airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators
 that it was too small to survive on 
 its own. The feds disagreed and blocked the deal.
 
 Now, of course, U.S. Airways has a new flight plan. Among those
 likely to get airsick: shareholders, whose investment has
 vanished; employees, many of whom are expected to lose their
 jobs, even though their unions have conceded hundreds of
 millions of dollars in pay; and creditors, especially
 plane-leasing companies, which will collect only as much as a
 bankruptcy judge approves. (Where, by the way, is the reporter
 who will pick up the story of these leasing companies? Not one
 creditor was named in any account we could find. Yet before we
 soak our hankies over U.S. Airways, we'd like to hear a word
 from the folks getting stiffed.)
 
 Need a silver lining? Check out the Wall Street Journal, which
 observes that Continental Airlines ""soared to profitability""
 thanks to its time in rehab a decade ago. We're guessing that
 anecdote is on the minds of Texas Pacific Group, which is
 plunking down $200 million for two-fifths of U.S. Airways. Texas 
 Pacific also played friend in need to Continental -- and
 pocketed 11 times its investment.
 
 Meanwhile, it will be ""business as usual"" for U.S. Airways
 customers, the company's chief assured a skeptical New York
 Times. The airline will even continue to track and to honor
 frequent-flier miles. Better still: Cautious customers can use
 U.S. Airways miles to book flights with its marketing partner,
 United. And, hey, according to an analyst quoted in the Journal, 
 there's at least a 20% chance that United won't be the next
 major carrier to announce it's gone broke. - Lori Patel

 REMEMBER GLOBAL CROSSING?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 Follow-up has never been the media's strong suit. Once stories
 fade from page one, so does reporters' interest. And in this
 summer of corporate scandals, remembering back to Global
 Crossing's January implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to 
 recall the fuss over chads.
 
 The Financial Times pegged the company's bankruptcy sale Friday
 a ""long-awaited"" transaction, but few other outlets seemed to be 
 holding their breath. The dearth of coverage is too bad, because 
 the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention,
 especially with Enron and WorldCom following behind it in the
 Chapter 11 aisle. Bankruptcy, it seems, means never having to
 say you're sorry. Global Crossing owed $12 billion when it filed 
 for bankruptcy in January. Its sale price? $250 million -- and
 that's for only a nearly two-thirds stake. Sound too low? Back
 in January, Global Crossing could have gotten much more, three
 times that much, and from the very same investment team, Asian
 conglomerates Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies
 Telemedia. But Global Crossing sniffed it was worth way more. 
 
 Now that it has discovered it's worth way less, here's how the
 deal carves up what's left of Global Crossing's pie, pending the 
 regulatory approval that's expected in about six months. The two 
 investors get a 61.5% stake; bank creditors get 6%, and
 bondholders get about a one-third share. Who's missing from the
 slice-and-dice? Shareholders, of course, who get nothing. The
 company is unapologetic, and creditors feel lucky for the
 crumbs. ""The reality is we could have done considerably worse,""
 the Wall Street Journal quoted Edward Weisenfelder, a lawyer for 
 the creditors. As for the shrewd buyers, the Financial Times
 quoted Hutchison's official statement that the deal would extend 
 its telecom capabilities, particularly in its broadband service. 
 But the Wall Street Journal speculated that the company is
 simply buying low so it can sell higher. 
 
 Global Crossing's turned-down offer of $750 million is
 approximately the same amount the company's founder, Gary
 Winnick, reaped in personal riches from the sale of his stock,
 as the Journal noted in its page-one story on the telecom
 bandits. That's a lot of paper bits on any floor. - Deborah
 Asbrand

 					<P>Creditors and shareholders of U.S. Airways found themselves in the upright and locked position Sunday as the nation's sixth-largest airline filed for bankruptcy protection.</P><P>
 The Arlington, Va.-based carrier sought cover under the bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, but much of its trouble could be traced to Sept. 11. Remember when all U.S. airports reopened except for Reagan Washington, which was too close to the White House and other gov sites? Remember how it was weeks before the first lonely flights lifted at last? Guess which airline was the major carrier there. (Hint: It's the same one that bled $2 billion in the past year.)</P><P>
 Even before the terror attacks, U.S. Airways was an animal in pain. To all the usual industry troubles, add these: fierce competition from discounters, a too-small area of service concentrated on the East Coast, and an unofficial battle with United Airlines for the highest labor costs in the business. Frustrated, the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years ago, reminded the Washington Post. In a bid to get bought by United, U.S. Airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators that it was
 too small to survive on <br>
 its own. The feds disagreed and blocked the deal.</P><P>
 Now, of course, U.S. Airways has a new flight plan. Among those likely to get airsick: shareholders, whose investment has vanished; employees, many of whom are expected to lose their jobs, even though their unions have conceded hundreds of millions of dollars in pay; and creditors, especially plane-leasing companies, which will collect only as much as a bankruptcy judge approves. (Where, by the way, is the reporter who will pick up the story of these leasing companies? Not one creditor was
 named in any account we could find. Yet before we soak our hankies over U.S. Airways, we'd like to hear a word from the folks getting stiffed.)</P><P>
 Need a silver lining? Check out the Wall Street Journal, which observes that Continental Airlines ""soared to profitability"" thanks to its time in rehab a decade ago. We're guessing that anecdote is on the minds of Texas Pacific Group, which is plunking down $200 million for two-fifths of U.S. Airways. Texas Pacific also played friend in need to Continental -- and pocketed 11 times its investment.</P><P>
 Meanwhile, it will be ""business as usual"" for U.S. Airways customers, the company's chief assured a skeptical New York Times. The airline will even continue to track and to honor frequent-flier miles. Better still: Cautious customers can use U.S. Airways miles to book flights with its marketing partner, United. And, hey, according to an analyst quoted in the Journal, there's at least a 20% chance that United won't be the next major carrier to announce it's gone broke. - Lori Patel</P><P>

 					<P>Follow-up has never been the media's strong suit. Once stories fade from page one, so does reporters' interest. And in this summer of corporate scandals, remembering back to Global Crossing's January implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to recall the fuss over chads.</P><P>
 The Financial Times pegged the company's bankruptcy sale Friday a ""long-awaited"" transaction, but few other outlets seemed to be holding their breath. The dearth of coverage is too bad, because the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention, especially with Enron and WorldCom following behind it in the Chapter 11 aisle. Bankruptcy, it seems, means never having to say you're sorry. Global Crossing owed $12 billion when it filed for bankruptcy in January. Its sale price? $250 million --
 and that's for only a nearly two-thirds stake. Sound too low? Back in January, Global Crossing could have gotten much more, three times that much, and from the very same investment team, Asian conglomerates Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies Telemedia. But Global Crossing sniffed it was worth way more. </P><P>
 Now that it has discovered it's worth way less, here's how the deal carves up what's left of Global Crossing's pie, pending the regulatory approval that's expected in about six months. The two investors get a 61.5% stake; bank creditors get 6%, and bondholders get about a one-third share. Who's missing from the slice-and-dice? Shareholders, of course, who get nothing. The company is unapologetic, and creditors feel lucky for the crumbs. ""The reality is we could have done considerably worse,""
 the Wall Street Journal quoted Edward Weisenfelder, a lawyer for the creditors. As for the shrewd buyers, the Financial Times quoted Hutchison's official statement that the deal would extend its telecom capabilities, particularly in its broadband service. But the Wall Street Journal speculated that the company is simply buying low so it can sell higher. </P><P>
 Global Crossing's turned-down offer of $750 million is approximately the same amount the company's founder, Gary Winnick, reaped in personal riches from the sale of his stock, as the Journal noted in its page-one story on the telecom bandits. That's a lot of paper bits on any floor. - Deborah Asbrand</P><P>

  I've just been re-aquainted with the Jumpstart stuff after a long
 absence.
 
  There is a nice need 'add_install_client' script that you feed the
 archtecture, ethernet address & ip to, and it'll setup everything from
 RARP to Bootparams for you. Very simple.
 
  This script takes a -d option, to boot via DHCP also. On the negative
 side, Sun's terminal handling leaves a lot to be desired - it won't work
 properly on a Wyse 120+ for instance, no matter what emulation mode the
 Wyse is trying to do.
 
  To do PC netbooting properly, you need an motherbard with a PXE BIOS.
 Then you are flying.
 
  Heh, how hard would it be to get a PC with an OpenBoot prom ?

 If you crypto-sign your outgoing mail, you don't have to set 
 your mailwall whitelist to accept unsigned mail spoofed as being 
 from you. 
 
 Similarly, if you include some weaker token or checksum that
 spammers can't easily guess. 
 
 If you can track the actual sender, then the proof that they've
 committed identity fraud is your credible testimony that you
 are the rightful user of the declared originating address, and
 that you did not send the message. I'm not sure what level of
 damages you could claim, though.

    <font size=""3""><b>Why we're changing our publishing schedule</b></font>
 
 <br><br>
 
 Dear Reader,
 <p>
 As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday
 <p>
 Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.  
 <p>
 Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.
 <p>
 Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.
 <p>
 For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. 
 <p>
 I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=00-4FQlI9QDB2t8PBibgi4cHr7W6TiR"" >CNET Radio</a> every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.
 <p>
 Sincerely,
 <p>
 
 David Coursey<br>
 Executive Editor<br>

 I see no reason to restrict the project to developing the classifier

 If this is new behaviour in a previously working network, what did you do to it?
 
   Test the cables by switching which machine has which.
   Test the hub ports by switching cables around.
   Run ifconfig on the server - any errors and what kind they are.
   Test the network card... by replacing the thing!
 
 Seriously, if the server has a PCI slot free, something like a Realtek 8139
 based card costs less than 20 euro.  The design is a couple of generations later
 - more memory, less cruft, no *FSCKING* dos config utility, no jumpers on the
 card and it's PCI.

 It has to be completely silent, or it'll do my nut. What do I need? 
 
 I'll prob use a shitty p166 i have here, it doesnt have a fan, and I'm not
 worried about HD noise too much as it'll be idle mostly (should I be?) 
 any info would be appreciated. I can't afford one of those lovely new

 pci wireless card and cable already bought (160$ or so)

 It could be specific to one of his bait addresses, though -- don't know.  A

 One of the things you need to understand with gnome2 is that while they
 did simplify a lot of things, most of the configuration options people
 found very useful are still available through gconf. Learn to love
 gconf-editor ;) -- metacity can have sloppy focus (Desktop Preferences
 -> Window Focus -- there's actually GUI for that), and the delay until
 raising (and whether it raises) can be set in gconf-editor,
 /apps/metacity/general/auto_raise and auto_raise_delay

 Well, it definitely is not the same as 1.4. Some people will always like
 gnome 1 better. Whatever suits your needs.

 I think you need to understand that simplifying the configuration
 options and the UI does make it a lot easier to use for people who are
 either not using it all the time or are just starting to use it. The
 GNOME team decided that advanced users who want to edit the kinds of
 options you talk about are advanced enough to use gconf-editor.
 Personally, I'm fine with that, because I don't find gconf-editor hard
 to use :)

 Looking for Property in Spain?
 
 Don_t waste your Time!
 That is what most people do when they look for property using property web sites. Why?
 
  Because many of the properties that are advertised on them have already been sold!
 
  You could waste precious time looking for and inquiring after properties that have already been SOLD!
 
  How Frustrating!!!
 
 The property market is moving very fast in Spain and frankly many estate agents do not have the time to update their web sites.
 
 What you need is a company that can find you property that is actually for sale and can present you with a selection of current properties that specifically fit your requirements.
 
 Just think of how much time and effort that would save you!

 That's exactly what is intended; the idea is that legit senders who
 habitually score just > 5, will eventually get out of ""AWL hell"" after
 6-10 messages.
 
 Note that running a single spam through ""spamassassin -a -t"" *will*
 eventually whitelist the spammer.  but that's why the man page tells you
 not to do it ;)

 It does.  If anybody in the nmh world actually gets to the point of actually 
 implementing imap access, this will need to change, but until there exists an 
 environment where the direct access doesn't work, we're not going to take the 
 performance hit.

122,"Subject: Securing multiple virtual hosts
","I am trying to secure three of four virtual hostnames on our Apache server.
 We are not taking credit card orders or user's personal information, but are
 merely hoping to secure email and calendar web transactions for our users.
 We are not running any secure applications on the root host.
 
 I have been testing this week with CA, client, and host certificate
 requests, certificates, and keys, and think I have a fairly good beginner's
 grasp of the commands and command line options.
 
 
 My questions are:
 
 1.  Is it necessary to create a CA certificate for each of the secure
 virtual hosts, or can one CA certificate for the root be used to sign each
 of the keys for all three common names we are trying to secure?
 
 2.  Even though the root host is not conducting secure transactions, am I
 correct in configuring the server with a CACertificateFile in the main body
 of httpsd.conf and then setting the CACertificateFile for each virtual host
 in the <Virtual . . .> section of httpsd.conf?  This sort of assumes the
 answer to 1. is  - you need a CA for each virtual host.
 
 3.  Is it necessary to create a client certificate to distribute to our
 users, or is it sufficient to have the CA certificate and a server
 certificate for the virtual hosts?  Wouldn't a client certificate only be
 necessary if we were trying to verify the client's identity?  Would that be
 a good idea given our scenario?
 
 Thanks in advance for your help.

","They are legally required to do that.  I got a similar check because an
 insurance company didn't pay a claim quickly enough.  It might have been
 $.02.
 
 Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the
 alternative seems to be to keep the money.  Do you really want companies
 to have a financial incentive to over-bill you 'just a bit' so they
 could keep it?  For a company with millions of customers, $.33/customer
 starts adding up.

 This is of course belated, as I'm sending it on the 18th, but Happy Birthday to Lori!
 <p>
 One thing about MacWorld should excite mp3 junkies -- the iPod just got 
 even bigger, with a 20GB version and Apple officially endorses Windows 
 compatibility. Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions 
 came down in price. Hearing that the only ""officially"" functional 
 Windows player is MusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my 
 opinion. Sure, MusicMatch is a decent player, but with plenty of great 
 free players on the market, why do we want to purchase a software 
 player in addition to the $299+ hardware unit?
 <p>
 At first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true 
 Windows compatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional 
 functionality, besides song management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's 
 <a href=""http://www.mediafour.com/products/xplay/"">XPlay</a> remains a 
 better option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an 
 iPod with almost any media player made for Windows, it assists with 
 contact management, via Outlook vCards, in addition to making the 
 iPod an additional drive on your PC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch 
 Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off Apple's officially endorsed player.
 <p>
 Lori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's 
 <a href=""http://www.sic.org"">SIC</a> without a hitch. I just missed a 
 face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of 
 <a href=""http://www.winferno.com"">winferno.com</a>, although I'm sure 
 we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the 
 <a href=""http://www.winferno.com/p/lg4/"">free copy of Research-Desk</a> 
 for all Gnomedex attendees. Shortly after arrival, I enjoyed dinner with 
 the <a href=""http://www.esellerate.net"">eSellerate</a> gang, with a 
 discussion about <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com"">GnomeTomes</a> and 
 what the future holds.
 <p>
 Every time I travel, I'm reminded just how slow dialup really is. Fortunately, my 
 <a href=""http://www.crosspaths.net"">Crosspaths.net</a> connection allows me 
 to send mail via my Lockergnome account, unlike most of the national dialup 
 services. Crosspaths is technically an Iowa ISP, although the have points of 
 presence in almost every major city in the country. If you're a dialup user, 
 you may want to take a look at their offerings, regardless of where you live. Lori 
 has used their DSL service for two years now, and they've been nothing short of 
 outstanding in dealing with customer service queries.

 This originally appeared in last weeks Webmaster Weekly, but due to its graphical nature, its worth inclusion here as well:
 <p>
 ""If you browse to a Web page that contains an image that has a transparent 
 background in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, the image background 
 may appear to be gray rather than transparent.""
 
 Fortunately, Microsoft explains a solution for this problem. Personally, I 
 haven't encountered this PNG display error, but for those of you

 Unknown artists across a variety of genres offer free mp3 downloads of 
 selected tracks, with an option to purchase songs on CD for the price 
 of shipping and handling. All CDs are professionally mastered works, 
 so you're getting label quality releases, without the jacked-up retail 
 price tag. The mp3s let you decide if the album is worth you $4.95. 
 The only thing I find odd about this site is their proclamation of 
 paying artists 50% of distribution profits, which I have to assume is 
 50% of zero, since the CDs are free. The artist selection contains 
 some solid releases by talented artists, regardless.

 <b>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</b> (NR) 1966<br>
 Adapted Play - 131min<br>

 Before directing Catch-22 and The Graduate, Mike Nichols made his big screen debut directing this adroit adaptation of Edward Albee's play ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?""  Nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, Academy Awards, this dark tale centers on history professor George (Richard Burton), and his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the college president.  At first George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love.  George and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs.  Just as quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise.  Soon Nick and Honey find themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.  Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead, alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.  Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and impeccable timing.  At one point George proposes ""Now that we're through with Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how about a little round of Get the Guests?""  This provides some idea of the precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold.  Ok, I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not have been much of a stretch.  Both actors, however, deliver their lines with the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying slaying.  Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax or look away.   Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is not a ""feel good"" movie. ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is, however, a memorable film that will stick with you for years to come.

 						<font size=""-1"">With all the corporate scandals--such as WorldCom and Enron--surrounding us, who can you trust nowadays? Well, for starters, you can trust the CNET Message Boards. The <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=c2-oXxLQUEk7X_ZoirgVnxXFZcIuInR"" >CNET Message Boards</a> are as real as it gets. When it comes down to giving or receiving honest tech advice, there's no better place to be. In the Boards there are no reviews or tests by professionals, just real, true-life experiences and discussions from people like you and me who share one common interest: the love of today's challenging technology. There are no sneaky execs here or scandals to worry about, so if you have a specific problem or question 
 in mind, post it! You won't be disappointed.

 <font face=""arial, helvetica""><b>The scoop on USB 2.0</b><br>
 <font size=""-1"">The chances are that the next time you pick up an external computer peripheral, it will be utilizing USB 2.0 to connect to your computer. So what is USB 2.0? Is it that much faster than USB 1.1? Will your current USB port be compatible with peripherals with the new version? Well if you have similar questions, I gathered up some discussion on this topic in hopes that it will bring a better understanding of what's in store for USB 2.0. Take your pick.

  Hmm. It's even worse than using a text editor on a file.

  Don't buy it.
 
  shift-alt-s should start a shell, alt-d should maximise a window
 vertically, alt-q should close a window, alt-w should shade it. These I've
 used for about eight years, and I'm not about to change them now.
 
  Stuff like alt-1 to go to workspace-1, I love - it just appeared in
 windowmaker about six years back, and I've also gotten used to it.

  Wierdly, I've gone back to sawfish & gnome 1.4 - and the keybindings
 still don't work. It's not fair.

   <p>
   Plug your Pocket PC into the USB port on the new TiVo
   Series2, and you can transfer recording onto the handheld to
   watch while you're on the go.
   <p>
   No, this one's false. First of all, none of the proposed
   ""home-entertainment features"" for the Series2 DVRs have been rolled
   out yet. And so far, neither TiVo nor its partners have
   proposed such a feature.

 kelly, same thing as when you used to come to frogstone on Dalnet. 
 #frogstone is still there, and also #forteana. If you want to go to

  I'd prefer to use an ISP that didn't tolerate spammers myself.
 
  The only way Spam lists work is because ISP's customers find they can't
 send mail to many domains, and ask the ISP to do something about it.

133,"Subject: ALSA (almost) made easy
","Hi all,
 
 I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is
 that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually
 testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality
 people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from
 that, right? ;-)
 
 I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages
 should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and
 maybe others, who knows ;-)
 
 Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :
 - Recompile the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm for your running kernel
   (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)
 - Install this ""alsa-driver"" package
 - Install the ""alsa-libs"" package
 - Install the ""alsa-utils"" package
 
 Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your
 /etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :
 http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/
 (very complete and very good documentation!)
 Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)
 
 Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need
 to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) ""by hand"" and
 insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (""dmesg"" to
 check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with
 e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.
 
 With ""aplay"" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You
 can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...
 hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3
 files... that's it!
 
 It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only
 thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't
 imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the
 /dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly
 %post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d
 structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the
 default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's
 development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static
 libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against
 which the ""alsa-driver"" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the
 rpm release, so does the architecture!).
 
 I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!
 
 Download :
 http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/
 
 Current spec files :
 http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec
 http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec
 http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec
 (All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )
 
 Matthias
 
 PS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply
 run ""xine -A alsa09"" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)

 You need to install the ""glut"" package from Red Hat Linux 8.0 (and
 ""glut-devel"" if you intend to recompile the source rpm).

 Here you need both ""aalib"" and ""lirc"" from freshrpms.net. They're small,
 they can be quite useful, that's why I've compiled xine with them as a
 default.
 You should be able to get rid of those two though, by rebuilding the source
 rpm (otherwise it's a bug in my packaging!) :
 rpmbuild --rebuild --without aalib --without lirc xine*.src.rpm

 It skips it. See the /etc/apt/apt.conf file for this.

 I've done a dist-upgrade from 7.2 to a quite broken rawhide release... it
 was a mess, still, it went much faster and smoother than if I had done it
 ""manually"" with rpm -U or -F. I think that updates between stable releases
 should still be done with the installer since IIRC, sometimes a few
 twitches are done by anaconda to migrate configurations to new formats. It
 should work though... I still prefer backuping config files and
 reinstalling a clean system when I have the time.

 Hmm. Seems like every CD player should include the
 capability to rip, encode, and cache the last few CDs 
 inserted. 
 
 Playback would then never need to face seek delays... 
 after the initial ripping, the only use of the laser 
 pickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted --
 which might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at-
 first-track operation.
 
 You could also take the CD out while it is ""playing"".
 
 Hmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don't
 even have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through
 UI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye of
 some sort... and the player recognizes it from the 
 silkscreening. Kids would like that. ""Play this,"" they'd
 say, facing the CD at the player, and the player would
 start immediately.

 This I would guess is normal, but don't you get it at the very beginning of

 I really wanted to go to this, especially to look at XOPUS. 
 Unfortunately, we're launching a new intranet at work next week and I 
 couldn't get away. XOPUS + an XML native DB such as Xindice looks like 
 something that could hit a home run.

 hmm... with pthreads there is always one thread which acts as a 
 'thread manager'. do the number of processes accumulate? or is it 
 just that the # of threads is == # of threads you're expecting + 1? 
 if the latter, ttbomk that is normal.
 
 ie, you dont create the thread until the accept() returns. so up 
 until then its a normal programme (ie no thread manager). after that 
 you will always have +1 processes (for the thread manager).
 
 also, the stack for further threads is allocated from the heap. (see
 sigaltstack() ) possibly glibc does not brk() back the space, just
 like malloc()/free() does not always release the space to the heap
 again (as most programmes will allocate memory / threads again
 soonish anyway).

 A bull market climbs a wall of worry -- on record volume.
 
 Yeah, I know, it's different this time. Pay no attention to the bear
 behind the curtain, and all that.
 
 However, at the end of the *last* bear market, in 1983 -- yup, that
 long ago -- Granville sell-orders caused bloodbaths with boring
 regularity, a stockholm-syndrome economy had recently been delivered
 of Keynesian monetary apparatchiks at the Fed and elsewhere, and
 Henry ""Dr. Doom"" Kauffman opined offhand that interest rates *might*
 come down finally... and pop! went the market, sending the NYSE
 volume through the roof. (Record volume then was around a hundred
 mill. Yesterday, ladies and germs, it was upward of 2 point something
 *billion* shares).. Back then, I was a mail-cart-pushing,
 key-punching ""administration"" clerk at Morgan Stanley in Chicago,
 chief scrounge for a bunch of Masters of the Universe, and everybody
 at Morgan thought the resulting price-pop was just a technical rally
 and wouldn't last either. :-). Six months later, people *still* said
 it wouldn't last, and a girlfriend's uncle was saying that it was too
 late, he'd missed the train, so he was going to stay out 'till the
 market came back down a bit. By that time, the Dow was at, what,
 1600? I wonder if he's still out, waiting...
 
 
 A 40% decline is a big chunk of change, boys and girls, even if it's
 40% of a bubble. Actually, by my count, it's 100% of the bubble, but
 that's just me. After all, Amazon and EBay's P/Es still need a
 pressurized cabin to breathe in.
 
 So, yes, the market may go lower, but not much more, relatively
 speaking. At some point, and fairly soon, I bet, someone's going to
 realize that, even though you wouldn't want to actually trade one for
 a house, tulips are still nice things to have around.
 
 Hint: Interest rates are rediculuously low, they aren't going up any
 time soon, and, if we can survive the election, the recently-started
 CEO witch-hunt won't be too much more than Street theater, probably
 not resulting in much in the way of regulation or legislation. The
 threat of which, frankly, probably caused this recent explosive
 decompression in the first place. Your tax dollars at work, if you
 will.
 
 So, in light of the erstwhile bloodbath on Capital Hill, and the real
 one we just saw a few days ago in the market, it may be time for
 people to remember what Mr. Rothschild said, and buy now while
 there's blood in the streets.
 
 As to whether the accounting is ""rigged"", remember what Robert
 Heinlein said: ""Who cares if the game is rigged? You can't win if you
 don't play.""
 
 
 
 Cheers,
 RAH
 The aforementioned girlfriend, by the way, traded *me* in for an
 actual Rothschild in 1984, after I insisted on going back to school
 and talking my way into the back door at the University of Chicago to
 boot. The cost of anything being the foregone alternative, it
 sometimes seems to me I'm *still* paying for that detour, but that's
 a bear of a different color, and it's okay as long as I don't look
 behind the curtain, right? :-).

 				P2P getting down to some serious work
       	
  
     
 	 By John Fontana
     Network World, 08/19/02
 	
  
 
 
 
 Just a few years removed from the mayhem of music swapping that clogged corporate networks, peer-to-peer technology is growing up and rediscovering its roots as a legitimate concept for distributed computing in corporate environments and the Internet.
 
 The turnaround is distinct since P2P has distanced itself from the darling days of Napster and has been transplanted onto the architectural drawing boards of Internet and corporate network gurus.
 
 For network executives, the about-face is showing up in such discrete places as wireless routing, identity management, Web services and grid computing. P2P has proved its worth - albeit with a few warts - in enterprise collaboration and content management applications, but its brightest future may be in the plumbing of corporate distributed computing.
  
 
 But even as P2P fades into the background, questions around security, standards and quality of service still have to be answered before P2P can flourish, experts say.
 The P2P evolution
 
 Regardless, P2P's evolution has hit its next stage. 
 
 ""Peer-to-peer is an architecture and one that will play a substantial role in distributed computing as endpoints in the network gain more power,"" says Jamie Lewis, CEO and research chair of Burton Group. He says that will be particularly important for Web services as peers share processes and data. ""P2P will become a fundamental part of how distributed computing evolves across the Internet and how enterprises build distributed systems internally."" 
 
 Lewis says the Internet today is very rudimentary with its basic protocols for basic operations. ""Now we're seriously talking about the network becoming the computer, incorporating some P2P connections and being able to share processes and power, which is what grid computing provides.""
 
 Observers say it's a renaissance.
 
 ""P2P's reverting to an architecture that can be applied to solve problems that by their very nature are distributed,"" says Neil Macehiter, senior consultant for Ovum, a research and consulting firm. ""But the question is can this model provide benefits for business use.""
 
 Macehiter says it can, but he cautions that security, such as removing blocks to P2P traffic on corporate firewalls, is still a major inhibitor to acceptance. 
 
 ""But you can imagine something like grid extending to share application logic instead of just being a data grid or a storage grid. When you look at Web services sharing business logic in the enterprise, you see the intersection with grid and P2P,"" he says.
 Working together
 
 To underscore P2P's evolution, the Global Grid Forum (GGF), a 2-year-old group founded by academics and researches, merged in April with the P2P Working Group, originally founded by Intel. The groups are attempting to marry the GGF's work on harnessing servers on a grid with P2P's ability to connect desktops.
 
 ""We're now trying to figure out how grid and P2P play nice together, and capture that power for use in enterprise computing,"" says Andrew Chien, co-director of the GGF's peer-to-peer area and CTO of Entropia, a provider of desktop grid applications.
 
 Late last month, the merged group began evaluating how P2P relates to the Open Grid Services Architecture, an effort to standardize grid computing. Chien says his group is exploring how P2P protocols for such things as registration, resource discovery and coordination of data transfer support a common grid infrastructure.
 
 And P2P's roots are reaching into other areas. It is an integral part of mobile wireless technology set for release this fall by MeshNetworks. The company's MeshLAN software extends the range of 802.11 wireless networks by making every wireless peer an endpoint in an ad-hoc P2P network and also a router/repeater to channel traffic to other peers.
 
 Using a patented multihopping technology, peers that are out of range of wireless access points or peers they wish to communicate with can hop through other peers to reach their destination, including corporate LANs. It not only increases the wireless range, it preserves throughput, which is up to 6 megabits. The technology also is mobile, letting hopping take place from nodes traveling in vehicles up to 250 mph.
 
 ""P2P allows us to do the hopping, and our algorithms allow the traffic to pick the most efficient path to travel,"" says Rick Rotondo, vice president of disruptive technologies for MeshNetworks. ""The beauty of a P2P network is that it is self-forming and self-healing.""
 
 And the technology is mature.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which created the Internet, spent $150 million developing the peer technology for use in forming instant networks among soldiers on a battlefield. MeshNetworks licensed it from DARPA has spent an additional $27 million to create a commercial product.
 
 P2P also is key to the PingID Project to create an identity management system similar to work under way by Microsoft and the Liberty Alliance Project, which are not using P2P. 
 
 ""Ideally, you need a way to create, manage and exchange digital identity information with no one in the middle of the transaction,"" says Andre Duran, founder of the project. He says that's P2P, but it's just one part of the equation. 
 
 ""Your ID is a virtual private vault with different drawers,"" Duran says. ""One drawer may be on your PC, one may be with a service provider, and you need a client to manage all that. We are building the infrastructure to support that.""
 
 Ping ID is working on server and client software that acts like a mini-Web server and maintains a repository of user's identity information. Users have the option of exchanging IDs directly through P2P or using client/server technology to authorize a third party to dispense their identity data. 
 
 ""P2P provides a level of control that other architectures don't,"" Duran says. ""It comes down to the fact that some applications are more efficient with P2P.""
 
 That is the concept that is driving P2P into so many different areas of computing.
 
 ""P2P has evolved from something highly disruptive to something complementary to intranets, extranets, mobile users and all the Web integration,"" says Greg Bolcer, CTO of Endeavors Technology, which develops a P2P collaboration software called Magi.
 
 And although P2P is still settling into this new role, it's obvious that its reputation as a music-swapping corporate scourge are now well behind it.

 Hey, that thing is 2 km across and 28 km/s fast. There's nothing you can
 do just before the impact with a system that was designed to deal with
 tiny ballistic missiles, and largely by damaging them, not destroying
 them. Apart from twiddling with the surface albedo which might be not
 enough -- we currently don't have ion drives with enough power, or at
 least we can't develop and deploy them on time, so that only leaves you
 with nukes. Assymetrical repeated flash-evaporation (anything closer would
 risk fragmenting it) on rocks of unknown composition (could be a pile of
 rubble for all what we know) has never been tried yet, though.

 It is much more interesting whether you can kill enough of delta v for a 
 capture. But here trying to brake a smaller object (say, few 100 m across) 
 with final stage aerobraking would be far more useful. Otoh, one could as 
 well could invest that effort into a launch capacity on the Moon.

 I've been in Austin all weekend. On Friday, I spoke at the University of Texas 
 about EFF issues. Jon Lebkowsky was there -- hell, he organized it -- and he 
 blogged the hell out of the talk: 
 
     Entertainment industry has tradition of attacking technology: the piano 
     roll, the radio (sued by vaudeville), television (would destroy cinema!), 
     ""the Betamax affair""... the latter being the first consumer VCR. In Betamax 
     case, argued that the ability to make a full copy of a broadcast work would 
     not be a fair use (in terms of copyright). It was illegal enough that the 
     VCR should be kept off the market, they argued. The Supreme Court got the 
     case, and the thing that shook out of it was the Betamax principle: a 
     technology is legal so long as it has substantial non-infringeing uses. 
     This principle is under attack. 
 
     Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998. Illegal to defeat a copyright 
     measure. Regionalization system for DVDs. This is a control that limits 
     distribution. John Johansen in Norway figured out how to break the content 
     scrambling system and allows you to move from one region to another, 
     override copy protection. It was called DeCSS - Johansen is facing trial 
     for creating a piece of code.

 For consultancy, integration or open source work, sure, perl, python or
 java with free use of external libs makes a lot of sense IMO.
 
 I should note that normally when I've used C or C++ in the past, it's
 dictated by the fact that I would be working on a commercial product,
 written from the ground up, where the code you're generating is important
 IP for the company; in this case, using a third-party lib often is not an
 option, or would be a PITA licensing-wise.
 
 Also, cutting out third-party dependencies can reduce the risk of ""oops,
 there goes the company that makes that library I depend on, now to shop
 around for something vaguely similar, figure out what bugs it's got,
 rewrite my code to use the new API, and hope for the best"".
 
 This can be a *very* big deal, for obvious reasons ;)    Open source
 knockers should note that this is not a problem when using LGPL'd libs ;)

 Im a man of my 40s and I really know my stuff.  I dont drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple 3.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!

 1.  Significantly reduce discomfort and pain!

 Well, SpamAssassin will just ignore any old X-Spam-whatever headers

 Now, to do this, we all know they have to be cracking the strong crypto used
 on all transaction in order to process them... So this has some preaty heavy
 implications, unless it's just BS.

 Or.... you could just not bloat it 20x to begin with. Nah! (that was the
 whole point of XML afterall, to sell more CPUs - much like Oracle's use of
 Java allows them to sell 3x more CPU licenses due to the performance hit)

 Again, see above... they _are_ claiming to decode the crypto...

 Mmmmmmmmmmm, machine code, never a good idea ;)

 Look at /etc/apt/apt.conf. I think ^kernel$ matches the kernel packages
 (apart from those matched by the rest, smp, enterprise).
 I think it won't do anything about the kernels. Come to think of it, the
 abovementioned might have nothing to do with it.
 
 I explicitly use apt-get install kernel and then from the list pick a
 version and then install kernel#2.4.foo-bar.

 Should. Haven't tried with dist-upgrade but I have put 7.2 netboot
 mirror (ie, 7.2) into sources.list and run install step-by-step for IIRC
 everything. Worked ok. I think there'll be a few .rpmnew files worth
 checking such as, especially, passwd and group.
 I think there was a group change. ""lock"" ?

175,"Subject: RE: The Big Jump
","Adjournment of Michel Fournier's big Jump in May, 2003.
 
 Two attempts of launch failed : the first because of the wind which got up
 prematurely and the second due to a technical hitch during the inflating of
 the envelope.
 The team of the Big Jump, folds luggage, having waited up to the end for an
 opportunity for the launch of the balloon stratosphrique allowing to raise
 the
 
 capsule pressurized by Michel Fournier at more than 40 000 metres in height.
 As expected, in the date of September 20, the jets stream strengthened in
 300 kph announcing the imminent arrival of the winter and closing until next
 May the meteorological window favorable to a human raid in the stratosphere.
 On the plains of Saskatchewan, the first snows are waited in the days which
 come.Meeting in all in May, 2003.

","This is due to insufficient write privileges to the ""razor-agent.log"" 
 file. A quick work-around is to do a ""chmod go+rx"" on that file (of 
 course, it's better to restrict the access as much as possible).
 
 In Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn't 
 have write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later 
 in the code when the log object is used, it fails with the ""unblessed"" 
 error.
 
 Hope this helps,

177,"Subject: Tablet PC
","Last week I had a chance to see some TabletPC's demonstrated, and I was very
 impressed.
 
 * Handwriting recognition was good, as was the ability to parse text from
 diagrammatic or graphic elements.
 * TabletPC form factors, while not perfect, are quite usable (light,
 relatively thin, some can convert from laptop to tablet use by flipping the
 screen).
 * Pushbutton switching between portrait and landscape screen orientation.
 * TabletPCs I saw came with built-in WiFi.
 * Good to very good integration of handwriting into existing applications,
 and there is a very nice new note-taking application specifically for
 handwritten notes.
 * Good set of APIs for adding handwriting into existing applications (at the
 most simple, it's only a few additional lines of code)
 * Prices of the hardware will be around mid-range laptop (will vary by
 model)
 
 I believe the TabletPC will be very successful, and is a much bigger deal
 than the relative lack of press coverage would suggest. I'm definitely
 starting to think about how I could incorporate one into my routine...

 I was thinking you could easily create a spamtrap which you 
 subscribe to lots of legitimate nonspam mailing lists, plus you 
 also spread the email address around and get it in the hands of 
 lots of spammers so it ends up receiving large quantities of 
 both spam and nonspam, then you have it apply the algorithm 
 above to the incoming mail stream.  So it could be thousands of 
 actual real, different, emails per day.  The ""very high rate 
 triggers alarms"" thing is certainly something which would be 
 possible to check for, but there may be legitimate ways to 
 exhibit this behavior -- can't think of one right now but ""AOL 
 proxy server"" springs to mind as an example from another domain.

 That's exactly what is intended; the idea is that legit senders who
 habitually score just > 5, will eventually get out of ""AWL hell"" after
 6-10 messages.
 
 Note that running a single spam through ""spamassassin -a -t"" *will*
 eventually whitelist the spammer.  but that's why the man page tells you
 not to do it ;)

   | Ever tried to get MH to *not* have a 'pseq' sequence?
 
 Hmm - I've been using MH for a long time (since well before there were
 sequences) and I don't think I've ever seen a ""pseq"" ...
 
 I'm guessing that that's the sequence that you have ""pick"" create
 As I recall it, it has no default sequence name, so the sequence names
 that people use will tend to vary from person to person won't they
 (except as MH configurations move around institutions by osmosis).
 
 I've always used ""sel"" for that purpose.
 
 I kind of doubt that any pre built-in sequence name is going to be
 very general.   Even ""unseen"" can be changed (fortunately that one
 is easy to find in the MH profile - though whether exmh does that,
 os just uses ""unseen"" I haven't bothered to find out).

 It is not uncommon to find gay males who had sex with several thousands
 partners (there would be more, in fact lots more, probably, but a lot of
 them have died). Don't have to be a callboy, if considering that you can

 Huh?  Are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard?
 Shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship. If
 shouting down public speakers is 'protected' it is only a matter of time
 before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against
 them -every single time they open their mouth-. The tactic is stupid and
 non-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos.  The tactic
 is just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos.
 And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society
 should be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is not
 really possible anyway, but hey, this is my rant :-). IMHO.

 Are the people who use procrustean web
 forms practices the same ones who don't
 accept faxes?
 
 When I *really* need to get something
 done, instead of just idle surfing, I
 call or fax.  Faxing, like a web form,
 can be done 24x7; it allows me to give
 all the (and only the) pertinent info
 in a single place; it also provides a
 self-journalled correspondence, which
 means rollback is easy and replay is
 even easier.

 I've been running a tiled (but somewhat
 overlapped, yielding a horizontal stack)
 window manager lately.  Like filling in
 a web form, finding edges and shuffling
 windows may seem productive, but I find
 that having a window manager manage the
 windows means I can concentrate on what
 I want to do with their contents.

 Back in my day, when one changed computer
 installations, email would be forwarded
 as a courtesy.
 
 Now, we seem to have swung so far in the
 opposite direction that it makes sense to
 ditch addresses every couple of years to
 shed spam.

190,"Subject: [ILUG] Create a PAYCHECK with your COMPUTER and Enjoy Cheap ISP & shopping Discount.
","Hi -
 
 ( http://club.4tfox.com )
 
 You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
 Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
 And they expect you to listen to them?
 
 Enough.
 
 If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
 hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
 a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
 show YOU how to do the same thing.
 
 This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
 can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
 an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.
 
 How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
 We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
 But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
 insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
 and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
 you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
 just the thing you are looking for.
 
 This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
 done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
 there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
 meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
 each month also).
 
 Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
 free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
 decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
 have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
 them incredibly well, if they work at it.
 
 To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
  web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
  informtion
 
 ""Send me a free membership!""
 
 Be sure to include your:
 1. First name
 2. Last name
 3. Email address (if different from above)
 
 We will confirm your position and send you a special report
 as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.
 
 If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)
 you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,
 Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,
 
 You can also go to the web address:
 http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService
 
 That's all there's to it.
 
 We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.
 
 Looking forward to hearing from you!
 
 Sincerely, 
 
 Hugh Zou
 
 P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
 marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
 This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
 REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
 and finally make real money on the internet.
 
 Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
 program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
 membership.

","I propose they rename it ""Charlie Heston High"" and maybe the students  
 will learn to take AR-15s with extended military-spec scopes and .223  
 high-velocity ammo and start plinking innocent civilians at random in  
 the suburbs of Washington.  That's far more effectual than blowing  
 oneself up in a bus.
 
 In America these days, it seems that violence ascribed to any political  
 doctrine foreign to Bushism is vile and repugnant.  But random violence  
 is entertainment and intrigue.
 
 A couple of ex-FBI ""consultants"" speaking on the shootings in DC were  
 quoted as saying the shooters, presumed to be a pair, were getting a  
 ""heroin-like high"" from each successful kill and that they ""for  
 whatever reason decided to level the playing field, thumbing their nose  
 at law enforcement and society.""
 
 See?  Just a couple of kids having fun with Daddy's semi-automatic  
 hunting rifle.  Harmless!

193,"Subject: [ILUG] Dell Inspiron 2650 X problem
","Howdy all, 
 
 I have a friend with the problem outlined below, suggestions anyone?
 
 
 ""I have a dell inspirion 2650 laptop, with a P4 1.6GHz proc., an Nvidia Geforce II graphics card (8Mb) and am trying  to 
 install redhat 7.3 .
 The installation goes nicely until the Xwindows setup. My graphics card IS detected but not the monitor. I have  
 randomly chosen various LCD laptop display monitors but none seem to work, problem is that when i test a  particular 
 monitor the screen doesn't default back to the nice clear picture  i have become acustomed to but  remains fuzzy and 
 flashy so it is impossible to test another monitor type. rebooting allows me to run in text mode  where i try to configure X 
 again with Xconfigurator but i run into the same problem again.
 
 Very annoying...""
 
 Ta very,

 I never used ConfigParser before, but I read that its read() method silently
 ignores files that don't exist.  If 'bayes.ini' isn't found, *none* of the
 options will be defined.  Since you want to run this from a directory other
 than my spambayes directory, it's up to you to check in changes to make that
 possible <wink>.

 Sure - discussion in Forbes - rigorous research, that. Especially when 
 the data in their own list
 contradicts them. I continue to look at the list and all the ""inherited, 
 growed"" entries. I guess if
 I read it enough times my vision will clear.

 I, at on point, looked into Stanford Business School. After learning 
 that tuition was > 20K,
 no financial aid was available, and part-time work was disallowed, this 
 smart person decided
 that I was not willing to spend the $150 application fee 
 (non-refundable). During attendance at
 my local business school, I was told repeatedly I should have gone for 
 it - to quote a prof, (Northwestern MBA), it
 has nothing to do with the education you receive - in general European 
 (and Canadian) business
 schools are better and more innovative - its the connections. He used 
 the words ""American nobility.""

 Its interesting but in this part of the World (Nova Scotia) a recent 
 study found that college graduates
 earn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges (trade schools). 
 They did decline to mention
 that the demand for some trades  is so great that some of
 them are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record - 
 the average salary for
 a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ 
 21,000  -- < $14,000 US. No wonder
 half of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call 
 centers that
 have arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some 
 entry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an
 hour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in 
 1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference
 is that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other 
 words, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, 
  union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument 
 to this is that many college graduates
  leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is 
 that we are the thin edge
 (one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of 
 third-world wages and work practices coming
  to North America.
 
 I worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they 
 could maintain that (and prosper) just says
  volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people 
 there, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote
 with my feet. They didn't quite realize that just about every large 
 employer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway
 eventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired 
 employees were brought in by the employer (rumours were
 that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of 
 rum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed
  a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, 
 guess what - used to be a VP at the company.
 That's free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - 
 as I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long
 as the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in 
 place.
 
 And if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of 
 some free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,
 are going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received 
 generous subsidies, in return, I'm sure, for an understanding about
 the labor markets here.

 Much as I like to accept what you say - I do believe in free markets , I 
 have difficulty finding any - except of course for
 labor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well 
 unless the supply is tight)
 It was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the 
 self-made billionaires on
 the list, but now we've got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the 
 concept of ""more stuff, cheaper""
 which it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. A particularly 
 galling example is
 high-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that 
 it is an area where the pricing
 approaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the 
 telecom industry (maintain your
 monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through 
 the same regulators) meet.
 Sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole 
 entertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing
 seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer 
 seems less important than using
 regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to 
 produce profits for the favored few.

 I usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office -  I feel like 
 they're the biggest believers in
 the Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the 
 rights of that ""proletariat"" you've
 just created with bogus ""law and order"" policies , concentrate capital 
 in the hands of a few (ideally people
 who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, 
 and lie - use
 the word ""compassionate"" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain 
 amount of poverty reduction actually
 helps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the 
 Republic party seems to be the more homeless under
  each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.
 
 And the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining 
 standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,
 greater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the 
 work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right
  to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining 
 standards of living) is the reality.
 
 Again to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - 
 the CIA world factbook - on the US economy:
 
 ""Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to 
 the top 20% of households""

 Your corpora are biased in this respect though -- newsgroups have a
 strong social taboo on posting HTML, but in many people's personal
 inboxes it is quite abundant.
 
 Getting a good ham corpus may prove to be a bigger hurdle than I
 though!  My own saved mail doesn't reflect what I receive, since I

 I'll bite.  Sounds like a good idea to strip the HTML in this case;
 I'd like to see how this improves the f-p rate on this corpus.

 Yesterday Viridiana came to my place and dragged me out to look at the sky. It 
 was beautiful. Odd colors and light. Obviously we wondered what it was. Today 
 Jim explains it. (It was a rocket test from the Vandenburg air force base). 
 Very neat. It was a bit too blurred out when I saw it, and there was too much 
 street light to make a good photo, so I am happy to have found the photo from 
 NASA...

","Quoting Breathnach, Proinnsias (Dublin) (breatpro@exchange.ie.ml.com):
 
 > Is there any reliable way to calculate your connection speed if you don't
 > trust what the modem reports?
 
 Do a wget of a file of known length, in a script that runs ""date"" before
 and after (or equivalent).
 
 Be aware that speed between you and your upstream link is one thing;
 speed through countless congested routers to a faraway location may be
 quite another.  Remember that hardware-level compression is a factor.
 (The file you wget will probably be precompressed.)
 
 In the area of the slightly more exotic, be aware that different traffic
 may have higher priority and thus more available bandwidth at various
 points in the transit to/from you -- and that some traffic may go via 
 different paths coming vs. going.
 
 Be aware that raw bulk transfer speed may not be the only thing that
 matters:  Depending on what you're doing, the modem's connection latency
 might matter, and this differs widely between modems.  (It matters more
 for interactive sessions, e.g., ssh remote logins, where each keystroke
 is echoed from remote.)

","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85516563
 Date: Not supplied
 
 Interview with cartoonist Ted Rall, who has traveled to South Asia recently, 
 and has tips on how to deal with bribe-hungry border guards and the like: 
 
     Rall: Now I realize that's just the way it is, and I know how to do it and 
     get away without paying a bribe, or paying something very modest. You have 
     to show them that you know the routine and that you know you don't have to 
     give them anything, and just have a low-key demeanor. But if you get angry, 
     that's just going to make things worse for you. You get out of your vehicle 
     and you walk up to them -- you don't try to avoid these guys; you don't try 
     to avoid their eyes -- you go up with a big smile, give them a big 
     handshake and sort of rub their shoulders and say, ""Hey, great to see you. 
     You're my new best friend for the next five minutes."" 
 
     GROTH: Basically act like a used car salesman. 
 
     RALL: It's exactly like that! You always carry cigarettes. You offer them a 
     cigarette, and you say, ""Hey, what's goin' on? How's it goin'? Great. 
     Here's my documents. How's the road?"" Just small talk, because these guys 
     are bored. They're in the middle of nowhere, and you're sometimes the only 
     vehicle they've seen for many hours. They're often very drunk, so you just 
     have to be cool.

     b> .. I wouldn't necessary say hate lit.
 
 Hate-lit rests on a premise that ""them"" are fundamentally different
 critters from ""us"" and thus, by being ""them-like"" they, as a
 classification, ""bring it on themselves"" for us to ""correct"" them by
 any means gruesome we might choose, after all, it's not /us/ pulling
 the trigger, it's ""them"", right?  I've heard Bush say this (verbatim)
 more than once, and with a straight face.
 
 Call it gay-bashing or whatever, it's convenient tunnel-vision and
 lies to justify violence against a creature genetically, morally and
 intellectually indistinguishable from your sister.  Go ahead, peel the
 skin off a random daughter of each of them and lay them side by side
 on the pavement, and you tell me which one was racially guilty, which
 one carried the ""infection"" the ""plague"" (note, not the ""antigen"" or
 the ""hormone"", which have similar metaphoric effects to philosophy,
 but they chose the fear-charged words)
 
 ""Make no mistake about it"" it oozes rhetorical vehicles to obfuscate
 it's lack of bits paragraph after paragraph in pushing an agenda to
 /excuse/ ""our"" violence and suspension of human rights to 'clense'
 ourselves of ""them"", the 'non-human' (or lesser-human) objects of its
 hate.
 
 What else shall we call it?  Just anti-liberal?  
 
 Better question: What if, as in physics, the laws of human behaviour
 are the same everywhere in the Universe?  What if Al Queda is in fact
 more like our mafia or biker gangs or school board trustees? 
 
 What if they operate by the same neural-annealing Maxima-Minima
 gratification mechanisms as you or I and every other creature on this
 planet?  
 
 What if, instead of magically and uniquely alien, they are, just like
 our own captains and leaders, really only in it for the money, for
 trade rights-of-way and for power over minions who will foolishly make
 it all happen, minions whom they can once again dup with /virtually/
 /identical/ rhetoric ... except we call theirs ""fundamentalist islam"",
 and they call ours ""imperialist satanism""?
 
 When both sides can call the other ""evil"" to the cheers of their local
 public and media, you can bet something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
 
 I guess that's why I live in the woods.  Bears and racoons I
 understand, but I really just don't 'get' people.

 Speech recognition will be the next transforming technology, but that transformation 
 may take another 50 years, says Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. Honored this week with 
 the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Moore took time to talk about the slowing down of 
 his well-known law, the economy, philanthropic priorities, and more.

 That's the theory, yes.

 No, but either due to some technical glitch, or downright just wanting
 to do so, people send to the secondary.  It's a semi-usual spammer trick
 actually to bypass the main server and send directly to a secondary
 since it will either have less filtering, or be ""trusted"", or ...
 
 MX records in the mail world are all explained in RFC 2821, section 5:
 
 [...]
    Multiple MX records contain a preference indication that MUST be used
    in sorting (see below).  Lower numbers are more preferred than higher
    ones.  If there are multiple destinations with the same preference
    and there is no clear reason to favor one (e.g., by recognition of an
    easily-reached address), then the sender-SMTP MUST randomize them to
    spread the load across multiple mail exchangers for a specific
    organization.
 [...]
    If it determines that it should relay the message without rewriting
    the address, it MUST sort the MX records to determine candidates for
    delivery.  The records are first ordered by preference, with the
    lowest-numbered records being most preferred.  The relay host MUST
    then inspect the list for any of the names or addresses by which it
    might be known in mail transactions.  If a matching record is found,
    all records at that preference level and higher-numbered ones MUST be
    discarded from consideration.  If there are no records left at that
    point, it is an error condition, and the message MUST be returned as
    undeliverable.  If records do remain, they SHOULD be tried, best
    preference first, as described above.

  From fairest creatures we desire increase,
 That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
 But as the riper should by time decease,
 His tender heir might bear his memory:
 But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
 Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
 Making a famine where abundance lies,
 Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
 Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
 And only herald to the gaudy spring,
 Within thine own bud buriest thy content
 And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
       Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
       To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

 Shakespeare, William.  Sonnets.
 
 William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,
 dramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English
 writer of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in
 Stratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him
 until he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway.  He enjoyed
 quick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a
 member of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the
 King's Men).  He retired in 1610, having spent a successful
 career as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants
 alike.
 
 Shakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the
 writer's life, leading many over the years to attempt to
 fill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that
 only result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will
 probably never know).  Among the rumors and hypotheses
 offered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;
 illiterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet
 (in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to
 take credit to shield the real writer -- a person with
 political ties).
 
 Shakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind
 and heart of the playwright.  Published in 1609, the 154
 sonnets involve the author's relationship with various
 characters, including a striking young man, a mysterious
 woman, and a rival poet.  The identities of the characters
 have also been the subject of much speculation over the
 years, despite the fact that they may have been completely
 created in the mind of the bard.

 For your kind attention,
 
 
               REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
 It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.
 
 I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Compan!
 y.
 
 Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.
 
 
 Yours Faithfully

 	As Hal noted, I like to have the unseen window visible in all
 virtual desktops, even if the main window is minimized. However, I looked
 through ALL the preferences menus, and didn't see anything resembling ""Show
 unseen message count in folder cache"". Where is that? And in what version?
 (I'm running v2.4 - 06/23/2000 - Creaky, I know.)
 
 	I went into twm with no virtual desktops, and it came up just fine.
 Going back to Enlightenment I saw the same behavior as before. Then I knew
 it MUST be something in the window manager, so I went digging. in my 
 ~/.englightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 file I found all the
 settings that E. uses for remembering border styles, positions, shaded
 state, etc. 
 	I have a 1600x1200 screen, and it kept putting my window at
 1655x150 (AND had it shaded to boot, so it was tiny as well as offscreen!)
 	Searching for 'unseen' in that file found this section:
 
 NEW: exmh.Exmh
 NAME: exmh
 CLASS: Exmh
 NEW: unseen.UnseenWin
 NAME: unseen
 CLASS: UnseenWin
 DESKTOP: 0
 RES: 1600 1200
 WH: 114 173
 XY: 1655 150 0 0
 LAYER: 4
 STICKY: 1
 SKIPTASK: 0
 SKIPWINLIST: 0
 SKIPFOCUS: 0
 SHADE: 2
 BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE
 
 	I changed:
 XY: 1655 150 0 0  	to 
 XY: 1455 150 0 0	so it would reappear in my viewable space,
 restarted Enlightenment (CTRL-ALT-End) and then restarted exmh. Bingo!
 There was my window! 
 
 	I quickly told Englightenment to forget everything about that
 window except is border style, and now have a sveldt little entry like so:
 
 NEW: exmh.Exmh
 NAME: exmh
 CLASS: Exmh
 NEW: unseen.UnseenWin
 NAME: unseen
 CLASS: UnseenWin
 BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE
 
 	Completely an Enlightenment problem, not exmh. (Though I wonder how
 it got mixed up in the first place? I certainly can't move a window off
 screen like that. Unless it was part way over then snapped offscreen when
 shading.)
 
 	Hmm. Weird. 
 
 	Anyway, thanks for the suggestions, folks. Hopefully this will be
 useful to someone scouting the archives in the future... :-)

 [2]Perl Mongers web site, you'll see that it's just got a good deal
 shorter. Over the last month or so, I've been making strenuous efforts to
 contact all of the groups we had listed to see which ones were still
 active. What you see is the result of this exercise. Almost half of the
 groups have been removed because they haven't responded to my emails.
 
 If your local group still exists but is no longer listed, then that means
 that I don't have an update to date contact for your group. Please [3]let
 me know if that's the case.""

 Intuitively, that sounds right to me.  It does also call ""tag remove"", so 
 you'll have to make sure that gets set correctly as well.
 
 I think any changes that make it behave more intuitively are a good thing even 
 if they mean we have something else to fix.  Of course, that attitude is why 
 I've been fixing exmh bugs for 3 weeks.

 They may be in for a patent fight before any of this goes forward:

 ""Banking on the fact that few enterprises sending commercial mail want to

 1) Right click on the folder label in the folder list
 
 2) In the main window, the ""+"" key puts you into a ""change 
    folder"" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
    hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode.  Type a few
    characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.

 There are a few net innovations that have far greater ramifications than you 
 would, at first hearing, expect them to. Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, 
 was one. Google News[1] is another. 
 
 In its first day, I've already noticed: 
 
 - The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth's 
 terminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by 
 the South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the 
 late evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. 
 - The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? 
 The most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google's coverage is what is a news 
 site, and what isn't. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very 
 obscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? 
 - Big companies spend mucho money paying ""clipping services"" that send them 
 copies of any press coverage they receive. Clipping services are going to have 
 to find some added value, very[7] very[8] quickly.

","  | Date: Fri, 19 Jul 2002 18:10:40 +0100
   | From: Ronan Waide <waider@waider.ie>
   | 
   | On July 19, niall@linux.ie said:
   | > this case, [hard links] are being used to provide two quite
   | > different namespaces for the same set of files.
   | 
   | Sure, but soft links would do the same. To be honest, I'm trying to
   | think of a useful use of hard links right now, and I'm a little
   | stumped. There's gotta be some benefit that I'm missing that's
   | immediately obvious to everyone.
 
  maybe, maybe not.   yonks ago, I seem to recall dmr saying,
  or at least alleged to have said, something along the lines
  that soft and hard links both make sense in isolation, but
  having both does not.  if this is even close to correct,
  yer in quite good company!
 
  there is at least one notable difference, and a host of minor
  ones.  the notable difference is the data always exists (and
  is apriori accessible) for hard links --- there is no such
  thing as a broken link.
 
  I use this fact on occasion to ""save"" data, via the well-
  known attack of hard-linking to a supposedly-temporary file
  I want to preserve.  the subsequent unlink(2)ing of the
  ""temporary"" file does not destroy the data.
  
 cheers!

 The two problems I see with filtering that early are:
 
     1. Everyone receiving email via that server will contribute ham to the
        stew, making the Bayesian classification less effective.
 
     2. Given that there will be some false positives, you absolutely have to
        put the mail somewhere.  You can't simply delete it.  (I also don't
        like the TMDA-ish business of replying with a msg that says, ""here's
        what you do to really get your message to me.""  That puts an extra
        burden on my correspondents.)  As an individual, I would prefer you
        put spammish messages somewhere where I can review them, not an
        anonymous sysadmin who I might not trust with my personal email
        (nothing against you Greg ;-).
 
 I personally prefer to manage this stuff at the user agent level.  Bandwidth
 is a heck of a lot cheaper than my time.

 No reboot is required, you just need to remount it:
 
 	# mount -o remount,rw /usr
 
 This requires root access, but presumably /usr is safe from non-root
 users anyway.
 
 Only way to disable this is to have the kernel compiled with something
 that compartmentalizes capabilities (LIDS/etc on Linux for example) or to
 remove CAP_SYS_ADMIN with lcap, which would definately require a reboot,
 and possibly break some other functionatily to boot.  (Pun intended.  My
 apologies.)

 CMP, owners of [0]The Perl Journal, have brought the journal back, in the
 form of an online monthly magazine, in PDF form. The subscription rate is
 $12 a year. They need 3,000 subscriptions to move forward (no word if
 existing subscriptions will be honored, or included in the 3,000).
 [0]Read the site for more details.
 
 I think some of the more interesting notes are that it will include ""a
 healthy dose of opinion"", as well a broadening of coverage including
 languages other than Perl (will this mean a name change?) and platforms
 other than Unix (I'd always thought one of TPJ's strengths was that it
 covered a wide variety of platforms).

 If the majority of your photos are posed snapshots and
 landscapes, a fast camera may not matter. But if you've ever
 missed a shot because your camera was busy processing the
 previous photo, the Leica Digilux 1 will appeal to you. We liked
 it too, and we gave it an Editors' Choice award.<!--

 Microsoft has released a media player for its Xbox game

   Answer to the question from the last newsletter:
   <p>
   Plug your Pocket PC into the USB port on the new TiVo
   Series2, and you can transfer recording onto the handheld to
   watch while you're on the go.
   <p>
   No, this one's false. First of all, none of the proposed
   ""home-entertainment features"" for the Series2 DVRs have been rolled
   out yet. And so far, neither TiVo nor its partners have
   proposed such a feature.

 Woops.  I didn't have the summary files so I regenerated them using a
 slightly different set of data.  Here are the results of enabling the

 My test set is different than Tim's in that all the email was received
 by the same account.  Also, my set contains email sent to me, not to
 mailing lists (I use a different addresses for mailing lists).  If
 people cook up more ideas I will be happy to test them.

 So it sounds as if, to your thinking,
 most useful apps are also trivial. 
 Unless each key on my keyboard were
 (to the apps) distinct event sources,
 I can't think of any of my usual job
 mix that would need hundreds, or even
 tens, of async requests; perhaps you
 can explain how nontrivial apps will
 be compellingly useful?

 Does that lack of portability imply it
 isn't generally useful?  (When it was
 apparent that TCP networks were useful,
 berkeley sockets could be found even
 on VMS and Win 3.1 boxen)
 
 Why would early Unix have run with the
 idea that, if one wishes to do multiple
 things at the same time, one can use a
 group of processes to do them?
 
 - they had Multics as a counterexample?
 
 - in the days of tiny memories and tapes,
   people were more accustomed to writing
   programs that didn't run entirely in a
   single address space?
 
 - one is a great number for an interface,
   as log(1) is 0, and specification can
   be implicit?
 
 - some combination of the above?
 
 Now, as Hoare says:
 > There are two ways of constructing a software design.  One way is to make

 As programmers, we've been able to make
 our lives complicated for at least half
 a century; the hardware interrupt gives
 us the rope.
 
 Part of Dijkstra's inspiration for THE
 was the counterexample of IBM's multi-
 programmed boxes (were these the same
 ones that inspired Mythical Man Month?)
 and I suppose he would say the question
 is how not to make a mess of it -- how
 should we structure computations so if
 we try to do ten times as many things
 at the same time, reasoning about the
 resulting system is at most ten times
 more complex -- not one hundred, and
 certainly not three and a half million
 times more.
 
 Compared to that project, the prospect
 of writing a driver library for various
 vendors' aio implementations seems to
 be truly trivial.
 
 -Dave
 
 (Oracle, in their quest for portability,
 used to use raw disks for the database.
 This finessed the filesystem issue; did
 it also allow them to roll their own set
 of async drivers?)

 ATTN:MANAGER
 
 
 
 HELLO DEAR,
 
 I am well confidence of your capability to assist me
 in
 a transaction for mutual benefit for both parties, ie
 (me and you) I am also believing that you will not
 expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about
 to establish on you. I have decided to contact you
 with greatest delight and personal respect.
 
 Well, I am BELLO SANKOH, Son to MR FODAY SANKOH
 who was arrested by the ECOMAOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
 months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
 Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
 in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
 move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
 Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
 Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
 containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
 Million dollars cash). This money was made from the
 sell of
 Gold and Diamond by my FATHER and he have already
 decided to use this money for future investment of
 the family before his arrest.
 
 Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
 documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
 father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
 Refugee by the Government of C=F4te d'Ivoire.
 
 Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
 trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
 money from C=F4te d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
 Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
 transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
 demand for the following requirement:
 
 (1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
 this fund will be transferred to in your country or
 another nearby country where taxation will not
 take great toll on the money?
 
 (2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
 travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
 come over to meet you in your country for
 the investment of this money?
 
 (3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
 business venture that would not require much technical
 expertise in your country where part of this fund
 will be invested?
 
 Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
 it will enable me to establish a stronger business
 relationship with you hence I will like you to be the
 general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
 Christian and I will please, want you to handle this
 transaction based on the trust I have established
 on you.
 
 For your assistance in this transaction, I have
 decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
 total amount ( 22 million dollars ) at the end of this
 business. The security of this business is very
 important to me and as such,
 I would like you to keep this business very
 confidential.
 
 I shall expect your urgent reply.
 
 My telephone number is 22507625348.
 
 Thank you and God bless you
 BELLO SANKOH Tel :22507625348

 After discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa, Steven 
 ""Hackers"" Levy interviewed lawmen, academics and WiFi activists about the 
 legality and ethics of using open wireless access points. 
 
     I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed 
     this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. ""The FBI wouldn't 
     waste resources on that,"" he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would 
     be hard to argue that I broke a law. What's more, I certainly didn't feel 
     illegal. Becauseand this is the point of all that war-driving and 
     -chalking and node-stumblingwhen you get used to wireless, the experience 
     feels more and more like a God-given right. One day we may breathe 
     bandwidth like oxygenand arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.

 My problem is not the same as MS's one, I don't have to deal with millions of 
 identical copy of the same CD with propably millions of working keys.  Each 
 download can be unique with a small preparation delay.  The key generator is 
 a problem only if multiple keys are usable.  If the end users are teenagers, 
 you'll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we 
 think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients 
 personnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible 
 steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.
 
 I agree with all of you that mass production CDs will not be safe from piracy 
 in a near futur.  That can be seen as a collateral of mass market 
 penetration.
 
 BTW thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight.  I'm playing with 
 gdb's dissassembler now but I don't think it's what a typical cracker would 
 use.  Any hints on UNIX cracking tools ?
 
 Thanks.

","Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with
 spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in
 other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.
 
 Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after
 regular spammers.  Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant
 pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the
 vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.  So, I
 can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers
 down when it's never really been tried.  We can subpoena the records of
 the business they spammed on behalf of.  We can subpoena the records of
 the ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for
 the whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.  Yes,
 these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  But, they're not
 secret agents.  They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' whole
 business is about finding them and putting them out of business
 
 Habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark)
 in a way that no one ever has had before.  Given that our whole business
 plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", I can't
 understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be
 unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the
 potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the
 Habeas warrant mark.
 
 Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on
 your installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only
 license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on
 the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove
 us from the next release.  But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it
 has a chance to show any promise.
 
 At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it
 encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those
 without SA) rather than yours.  Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the
 transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't
 steal any more cars.  But only if we're given a chance to succeed.

 Haha!!!
 
 Just a few notes:
 
  - It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone
    in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a
    good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law.
 
  - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court
    case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes!
 
  - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen
    cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc.
 
  - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I
    don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,
    some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,
    ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly
    required for the spammer to get their way.

 Thugs of South Boston and The Revenge of the Bandit Princess
 
 
 The Geodesic Economy
 Robert A. Hettinga
 Sunday, August 25, 2002
 
 (BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs.
 Patriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race war
 between thugs.
 
 Put crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gang
 were the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha's ""family"" were, of
 course, the (mostly) Italian thugs.
 
 
 Think Scorsese's upcoming ""Gangs of New York"", only with
 counter-reformatory overtones. Hoover's South Boston ""social-club""
 putsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious in
 hindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite
 a reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation's rackets by
 the Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not
 for New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US,
 only makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to
 its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime
 there once and for all.
 
 The result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin of
 Italian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was,
 posthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine
 - -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violence
 in Whitey Bulger's crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston's drug markets,
 like the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other
 also-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders of
 magnitude, not mere percentage points.
 
 As Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it's own. And, make
 no mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that ""quality""
 of carnage, nation-wide.
 
 
 So, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one
 gang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at
 least, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, with
 apparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on
 the gears of ""justice"" like so much hamburger.
 
 However, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was
 ""greasing"", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could
 love: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence --
 on paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door,
 but still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken's famous ""bluenoses
 and busybodies"".
 
 
 It all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of
 beginnings. What she couldn't do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy
 then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a
 smaller, ""manageable"" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more
 heads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition,
 in more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on.
 
 Every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or
 harmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now,
 apparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing
 happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead
 years. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely
 lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently
 scale newly-legislated ""barriers to competition"" imposed on them by
 the state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of
 those substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of
 evil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly
 coercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred
 liberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry.
 
 As Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don't need
 government if nobody's breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to
 Parkinson's Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people,
 breaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they
 confiscate at tax time.
 
 And, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably
 echo here his father Milton's famous observation that government
 regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and
 never the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even,
 *especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in
 the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our
 government now imposes on us.
 
 
 And there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati.
 
 In fact, Hayek himself, in ""The Road to Serfdom"", couldn't have
 predicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover's blatant
 imposition, ""for our own good"", of Vietnam-era statist power at the
 neighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn't have had
 better ""useful idiots"" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an
 absolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover.
 
 Useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who
 were eating out of Hoover's power-craven hand for the entire middle
 of the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger's hand, whether they knew it
 or not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you'll notice, which
 saw the increasingly steady imposition of ""mob"" violence, and market
 control, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the
 imaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting,
 movie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little
 Caesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now
 strictly political, descendents.
 
 In terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr.
 Salvati and the others, dead or alive, as a ""transfer-price"", in
 human lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style
 Vietnam-era Keynesian ""social-cost"" input-output accounting at its
 most despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that
 was committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic
 control, in the name of what really was, as you'll now agree, just a
 race war between thugs up in Boston.
 
 
 This shouldn't be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least
 fought by thugs, though they're usually conceived elsewhere, and
 endorsed, at the time, by all the ""right"" people, for all the ""right""
 reasons.
 
 As far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson's observation
 that a ""prince"" is just a stationary bandit.
 
 Though, given his penchant for women's clothing, for other men, and,
 what's actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of
 people of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J.
 Edgar Hoover a bandit ""princess"", instead.
 
 ""Bandit Queen"", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens --
 and real bandits -- everywhere.

 RAH

 Hoover's F.B.I. and the Mafia: Case of Bad Bedfellows Grows By FOX
 BUTTERFIELD
 
 BOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. Edgar
 Hoover's war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional
 investigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of
 New England's organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca.
 
 Two gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr.
 Patriarca's permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan,
 ""as they were having a problem with him,"" according to an F.B.I. log
 of the conversation. ""Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.,"" the
 F.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an
 alley, shot six times.
 
 It was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau of
 Investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known
 gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England
 Mafia was involved.
 
 But when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real
 killers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were
 left alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to
 death or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing
 to do with it.
 
 One, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with
 the Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I.
 for $300 million for false imprisonment.
 
 His is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the
 Justice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled,
 corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.'s Boston
 office in its effort to bring down the mob.
 
 The lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years
 in a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of
 the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light,
 including documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca
 approved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation
 by the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the
 department into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston.
 
 The documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently
 including Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents
 were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were
 protecting them from prosecution.
 
 ""J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal
 himself,"" said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati's lawyer. ""He allowed a
 witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect
 one of his informants.""
 
 Mr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and
 may have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark
 who worked for Mr. Barboza.
 
 Asked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr.
 Salvati's innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a
 spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the
 pending litigation.
 
 A Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate
 misconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the
 investigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting
 sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and
 obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were
 F.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and
 Stephen Flemmi are brothers.
 
 The Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton,
 Republican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston
 office to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau's knowledge
 that Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr.
 Deegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime,
 including who fired the first shot.
 
 Then, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover's office demanded to know what
 progress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer.
 
 In a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston
 office said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot
 wounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca ""potentially
 could be an excellent informant.""
 
 The agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have
 killed seven men, ""and, from all indications, he is going to continue
 to commit murder."" Nevertheless, the agent said, ""the informant's
 potential outweighs the risk involved.""
 
 A Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. ""The most
 frightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi's murders,
 the director does not even respond,"" the investigator said. ""There is
 no message not to use a murderer as a government informant.""
 
 The origin of the corruption scandal was public and political
 pressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing
 power of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I.
 agents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties
 to a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr.
 Bulger.
 
 Both sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and
 the trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually
 helped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled
 organized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger's gang was able to take
 over the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while
 the F.B.I. looked the other way.
 
 One reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr.
 Patriarca's involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional
 investigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device
 in his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent who
 transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was
 coming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device,
 the investigators say.
 
 Mr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted
 in 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still on
 parole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state
 judge after the Justice Department task force made public documents
 suggesting his innocence.
 
 Two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Their
 survivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 million
 lawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced to
 die in the electric chair. His life was spared only when
 Massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974.
 
 Mr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston's North End with
 his wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30
 years. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put
 on the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of each
 other.

   Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks 
   Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET 
   By Peter Henderson 
 
   SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday
   said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as
   straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.
 
   It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld
   unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals
   making computers which manage networks. 
   EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage
   resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for
   broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working
   to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break.
 
   ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the
   whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box
   it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an
   interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. 
 
   Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or
   water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever
   needed. 
   For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling
   them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are
   still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from
   different vendors to interoperate closely. 
   Sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at
   their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today
   often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. 
 
   ""It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised MacKay
   The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as
   online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. 
   Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on
   the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response
   time for priority users, the company said.

 		<b>If the nation's politicians expect Silicon Valley to fall in line on the issue of expensing stock options, they're living in a fantasy world.</b>
 		<p>
 
 		Flipping through my Rolodex this past week, I couldn't find one solitary technology type willing to support even the mildest proposal to change how corporations account for stock options. The more common response was a verbal ""middle finger"" shouted in the general direction of Washington.
 		<p>
 
 		No surprises, there. The options argument is not just about putting food on the table--make that <i>a lot</i> of food, in some cases--but about the way the computer industry views itself. Tech companies believe they belong in a different category, say, from the likes of Coca Cola, Washington Post Co. and Bank One Corp.--all which recently decided to begin expensing stock options.
 		<p>
 
 		Tech titans also served notice they will remember to support friends--and shun foes--in Washington next November. An empty threat? Perhaps, but consider this: in the last national election, the computer industry contributed more than $40 million (52 percent to Democrats, 46 percent to Republicans.) That was good for a seventh place <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=39-7QgMIjIiVpWATh6CGLs-y39w-_lR"" >ranking</a>, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

 Dear gawd - 'lost its reputation' - how horrible for those Northern
 Europeans. What could possibly be worse than that?

 Through daily use I've found that <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=2d-OxQyIbKH-P5mHcLVdngyV7VDjSuR"" >Mozilla</a> and <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=42-rF7cIPKSKpADjH7pz3F7_4EMIryR"" >Opera</a> Web browsers beat Internet Explorer because of two features: tabbed windows and built-in pop-up killers. But occasionally I hit a site that has features that don't work or has a messed up layout, so I have to launch IE to view it correctly. In the last couple of years, Web builders have used <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=57-YJIXII04FpVebwYF0F_wt9Q9dZPR"" >proprietary code</a> from Microsoft in their sites, which Mozilla and Opera don't support.
 <p>
 I used to cover Web building, so I have plenty of insight into the problem. Using current, standard HTML and JavaScript, Web builders can make a Web site do almost anything that you could with Microsoft's proprietary code. The only things they can't do are goofy enhancements such as changing the browser scroll bar colors. To solve this compatibility problem, either Web builders have to take proprietary tags out of their sites or users have to use IE to view them. You can also enhance IE with utilities such as <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=6c-SUL3IuPjjW1GrwIKQCL5-NPyEdnR"" >Secure IE</a> to get the kinds of features offered by Mozilla and Opera, giving you the best of both worlds.
 <p>
 Who do you think should be solving problems of Web site incompatibility: Web builders, users, or browser manufacturers? Let me know at <a href=""mailto:edit@download.com?subject=browse%20orbust"">edit@download.com</a>.

     week's column, Dan Tynan takes security matters into his own
     hands and shows you how to protect yourself.

     but two software apps bring iPod compatibility to your
     FireWire-equipped PC. EphPod and XPlay square off in this
     battle of cross-platform compatibility.

 <b>Last week I asked whether Audiogalaxy could survive only offering non-infringing files. Here are a few of your answers:</b>
 
 <p><FONT size=""-1"" color=006633><i>""Doomed. Completely, absolutely, utterly!""</i></font><p>
 Just about everyone agreed that Audiogalaxy is as dead as Napster.
 
 <p><FONT size=""-1"" color=006633><i>""Each time a file-sharing service is canceled, a bunch of new ones appear.""</i></font><p>
 But some people always find a silver lining.
 
 <p><FONT size=""-1"" color=006633><i>""I might use a file-sharing service for a lot of things, particularly drivers, fixes, and patches.""</i></font><p>
 A P2P network offering drivers seems like a great idea to me.
 
 <p><FONT size=""-1"" color=006633><i>""I was an occasional Audiogalaxy participant (birthday CD burned to include songs that were hits the year you were born). Now I'll just opt for a birthday card and a bottle of wine.""</i></font><p>
 I included this comment because I really like the birthday idea.
 
 <p><FONT size=""-1"" color=006633><i>""It seems once again rather than release a file download site for music, at a fee per download, the music companies spend money on trying to stop download sites like Audiogalaxy.""</i></font><p>
 With its popularity, file swapping should be an amazing opportunity for record companies, but they must not be smart enough to figure out how to make it work.

 Having skimmed over the patent, it appears to be describing a sort of
 image compression algorithm which gels more or less with the JPEG
 mechanism. Since I don't quite understand how jpeg works (it's hard
 math, and I'm just a dumb comp. eng.) I don't know how exactly it
 matches up to JPEG. I'm more curious as to whether it covers MPEG,
 because it /is/ described in the context of video streams rather than
 stills, and I had a vague impression that the MPEG and JPEG
 compression techniques were similar. One of the patents it references
 also seems to hint at MPEG.
 
 Let's all use PNG, eh? *cough* *wheeze*
 
 Cheers,
 Waider.

 <h3>USING ARRAYLIST AND LINKEDLIST</h3>
 
 <p>
 <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code> are two <code>Collections</code> classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an <code>ArrayList</code> of Strings, or a <code>LinkedList</code> of Integers. This tip compares the performance of <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code>, and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The first key point is that an <code>ArrayList</code> is backed by a primitive <code>Object</code> array. Because of that, an <code>ArrayList</code> is much faster than a <code>LinkedList</code> for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the <code>get</code> method. Note that the <code>get</code> method is implemented for <code>LinkedLists</code>, but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a <code>LinkedList</code>, there's no fast way to access the Nth element of the list.
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
 Consider the following example. Suppose you have a large list of sorted elements, either an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>. Suppose too that you do a binary search on the list. The standard binary search algorithm starts by checking the search key against the value in the middle of the list. If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Here's a program that does a binary search on all the elements in an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
 
     public class ListDemo1 {
         static final int N = 10000;
 
         static List values;
 
         // make List of increasing Integer values
 
         static {
            Integer vals[] = new Integer[N];
 
            Random rn = new Random();
 
            for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                vals[i] = new Integer(currval);
                currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;
            }
 
            values = Arrays.asList(vals);
         }
         
         // iterate across a list and look up every
         // value in the list using binary search
 
         static long timeList(List lst) {
             long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
 
                // look up a value in the list 
                // using binary search
 
                int indx = Collections.binarySearch(
                                    lst, values.get(i));
 
                // sanity check for result 
                // of binary search
 
                if (indx != i) {
                    System.out.println(
                                     &quot;*** error ***\n&quot;);
                }
            }
 
            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        }
 
        public static void main(String args[]) {
 
            // do lookups in an ArrayList 
 
            System.out.println(&quot;time for ArrayList = &quot; +
                timeList(new ArrayList(values)));
 
            // do lookups in a LinkedList
 
            System.out.println(
                &quot;time for LinkedList = &quot; +
                timeList(new LinkedList(values)));
        }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The <code>ListDemo1</code> program sets up a <code>List</code> of sorted Integer values. It then adds the values to an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>. Then <code>Collections.binarySearch</code> is used to search for each value in the 
 list.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 When you run this program, you should see a result that looks something like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     time for ArrayList = 31
 
     time for LinkedList = 4640
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 <code>ArrayList</code> is about 150 times faster than <code>LinkedList</code>. (Your results might differ depending on your machine characteristics, but you should see a distinct difference in the result for <code>ArrayList</code> as compared to that for <code>LinkedList</code>. The same is true for the other programs in this tip.) Clearly, <code>LinkedList</code> is a bad choice in this situation. The binary search algorithm inherently uses random access, and <code>LinkedList</code> does not support fast random access. The time to do a random access in a <code>LinkedList</code> is proportional to the size of the list. By comparison, random access in an <code>ArrayList</code> has a fixed time.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 You can use the <code>RandomAccess</code> marker interface to check whether a List supports fast random access:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     void f(List lst) {
         if (lst instanceof RandomAccess) {
             // supports fast random access
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 <code>ArrayList</code> implements the <code>RandomAccess</code> interface, and <code>LinkedList</code>. does not. Note that <code>Collections.binarySearch</code> does take advantage of the <code>RandomAccess</code> property, to optimize searches.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Do these results prove that <code>ArrayList</code> is always a better choice? Not necessarily. There are many cases where <code>LinkedList</code> does better. Also note that there are many situations where an algorithm can be implemented efficiently for <code>LinkedList</code>. An example is reversing a <code>LinkedList</code> using <code>Collections.reverse</code>. The internal algorithm does this, and gets reasonable performance, by using forward and backward iterators.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Let's look at another example. Suppose you have a list of elements, and you do a lot of element inserting and deleting to the list. In this case, <code>LinkedList</code> is the better choice. To demonstrate that, consider the following &quot;worst case&quot; scenario. In this demo, a program repeatedly inserts elements at the beginning of a list. The code looks like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
 
     public class ListDemo2 {
         static final int N = 50000;
 
         // time how long it takes to add 
         // N objects to a list
 
         static long timeList(List lst) {
             long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 
             Object obj = new Object();
 
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 lst.add(0, obj);
             }
 
             return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
         }
 
         public static void main(String args[]) {
 
             // do timing for ArrayList
 
             System.out.println(
                 &quot;time for ArrayList = &quot; +
                 timeList(new ArrayList()));
 
             // do timing for LinkedList
 
             System.out.println(
                 &quot;time for LinkedList = &quot; +
                 timeList(new LinkedList()));
         }
     } 
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 When you run this program, the result should look something like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     time for ArrayList = 4859
 
     time for LinkedList = 125
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 These results are pretty much the reverse of the previous example.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 When an element is added to the beginning of an <code>ArrayList</code>, all of the existing elements must be pushed back, which means a lot of expensive data movement and copying. By contrast, adding an element to the beginning of a <code>LinkedList</code> simply means allocating an internal record for the element and then adjusting a couple of links. Adding to the beginning of a <code>LinkedList</code> has fixed cost, but adding to the beginning of an <code>ArrayList</code> has a cost that's proportional to the list size.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 So far, this tip has looked at speed issues, but what about space? Let's look at some internal details of how <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code> are implemented in Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition v 1.4. These details are not part of the external specification of these classes, but are illustrative of how such classes work internally.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The <code>LinkedList</code> class has a private internal class defined like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     private static class Entry {
         Object element;
         Entry next;
         Entry previous;
     } 
 </pre>
 
 
 <p>
 Each <code>Entry</code> object references a list element, along with the next and previous elements in the <code>LinkedList</code> -- in other words, a doubly-linked list. A <code>LinkedList</code> of 1000 elements will have 1000 <code>Entry</code> objects linked together, referencing the actual list elements. There is significant space overhead in a <code>LinkedList</code> structure, given all these <code>Entry</code> objects.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 An <code>ArrayList</code> has a backing <code>Object</code> array to store the elements. This array starts with a capacity of 10. When the array needs to grow, the new capacity is computed as:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     newCapacity = (oldCapacity * 3) / 2 + 1;
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 Notice that the array capacity grows each time by about 50%. This means that if you have an <code>ArrayList</code> with a large number of elements, there will be a significant amount of space wasted at the end. This waste is intrinsic to the way <code>ArrayList</code> works. If there was no spare capacity, the array would have to be reallocated for each new element, and performance would suffer dramatically. Changing the growth strategy to be more aggressive (such as doubling the size at each reallocation) would result in slightly better performance, but it would waste more space.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 If you know how many elements will be in an <code>ArrayList</code>, you can specify the capacity to the constructor. You can also call the <code>trimToSize</code> method after the fact to reallocate the internal array. This gets rid of the wasted space.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 So far, this discussion has assumed that either an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code> is &quot;right&quot; for a given application. But sometimes, other choices make more sense. For example, consider the very common situation where you have a list of key/value pairs, and you would like to retrieve a value for a given key.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 You could store the pairs in an N x 2 <code>Object</code> array. To find the right pair, you could do a sequential search on the key values. This approach works, and is a useful choice for very small lists (say 10 elements or less), but it doesn't scale to big lists.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Another approach is to sort the key/value pairs by ascending key value, store the result in a pair of <code>ArrayLists</code>, and then do a binary search on the keys list. This approach also works, and is very fast. Yet another approach is to not use a list structure at all, but instead use a map structure (hash table), in the form of a <code>HashMap</code>.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Which is faster, a binary search on an <code>ArrayList</code>, or a <code>HashMap</code>? Here's a final example that compares these two:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
 
     public class ListDemo3 {
         static final int N = 500000;
 
         // Lists of keys and values
 
         static List keys;
         static List values;
 
         // fill the keys list with ascending order key 
         // values and fill the values list with
         // corresponding values (-key)

             // do timing for List implementation
 
             System.out.println(""List time = "" + 
                                            timeList());
 
             // do timing for Map implementation
 
             System.out.println(&quot;Map time = &quot; + 
                                             timeMap());
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The program sets up <code>Lists</code> of keys and values, and then uses two different techniques to map keys to values. One approach uses a binary search on a list, the other a hash table.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 When you run the <code>ListDemo3</code> program, you should get a result that looks something like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     ArrayList time = 1000
 
     HashMap time = 281
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 In this example, N has a value of 500000. Approximately, log2(N) - 1 comparisons are required in an average successful binary search, so each binary search lookup in the <code>ArrayList</code> will take about 18 comparisons. By contrast, a properly implemented hash table typically requires only 1-3 comparisons. So you should expect the hash table to be faster in this case.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 However, binary search is still useful. For example, you might want to do a lookup in a sorted list and then find keys that are close in value to the key used for the lookup. Doing this is easy with binary search, but impossible in a hash table. Keys in a hash table are stored in apparent random order. Also, if you are concerned with worst-case performance, the binary search algorithm offers a much stronger performance guarantee than a hash table scheme. You might also consider using TreeMap for doing lookups in sorted collections of key/value pairs.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Let's summarize the key points presented in this tip:
 </p>
 
 <ul>
   <li>Appending elements to the end of a list has a fixed averaged cost for both <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList.</code> For <code>ArrayList</code>, appending typically involves setting an internal array location to the element reference, but occasionally results in the array being reallocated. For <code>LinkedList</code>, the cost is uniform and involves allocating an internal <code>Entry</code> object.</li>
 
   <li>Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an <code>ArrayList</code> implies that the rest of the list must be moved. Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a <code>LinkedList</code> has fixed cost.</li>
 
   <li>A <code>LinkedList</code> does not support efficient random access</li>
 
   <li>An <code>ArrayList</code> has space overhead in the form of reserve capacity at the end of the list. A <code>LinkedList</code> has significant space overhead per element.</li>
 
   <li>Sometimes a <code>Map</code> structure is a better choice than a <code>List</code>.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>USING ZERO-LENGTH ARRAYS</h3>
 
 <p>
 Suppose that you are writing a Java application that involves some sort of data filtering. You have some raw data that you want to clean up and process in various ways. One of the methods you've written takes an array of integers, along with minimum and maximum values. The method goes through the array and eliminates &quot;outliers,&quot; that is, values that are too small or too big. The result of the filtering process is a new array of cleaned-up data.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 How could you implement this kind of filtering method? Here's one approach:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
     
     public class ZeroDemo1 {
     
         // filter input array and throw away values 
         // that are less than minval or greater than 
         // maxval
     
         static int[] filterData(
                 int indata[], int minval, int maxval) {
     
             // check parameters for errors 
     
             if (indata == null) {
                 throw new NullPointerException(
                                      &quot;indata is null&quot;);
             }
             if (maxval &lt; minval) {
                 throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                 &quot;maxval &lt; minval&quot;);
             }
     
             // count number of valid values 
             // in input array
     
             int validcnt = 0;
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; indata.length; i++) {
                 if (indata[i] &gt;= minval &amp;&amp; indata[i] 
                                          &lt;= maxval) {
                     validcnt++;
                 }
             }
     
             // if no valid values, return null
     
             if (validcnt == 0) {
                 return null;
             }
     
             // copy valid values to new array 
             // and return it
     
             int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];
             for (int i = 0, j = 0; 
                               i &lt; indata.length; i++) {
                 if (indata[i] &gt;= minval &amp;&amp; indata[i] 
                                            &lt;= maxval) {
                     outdata[j++] = indata[i];
                 }
             }
             return outdata;
         }
     
         public static void main(String args[]) {
     
             // set up test array of integers
     
             int indata[] = new int[]{1, 3, -17, 8, 59};
     
             // filter out values not in the range 1-10
     
             int outdata1[] = filterData(indata, 1, 10);
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; outdata1.length; i++) {
                 System.out.println(outdata1[i]);
             }
     
             // filter out values not 
             // in the range 100-200
     
             int outdata2[] = filterData(
                                      indata, 100, 200);
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; outdata2.length; i++) {
                 System.out.println(outdata2[i]);
             }
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The <code>filterData</code> method does two scans of the input array. The first scan counts the number of valid data values. Then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. If there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The result of running the <code>ZeroDemo1</code> program is:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     1
     3
     8
     Exception in thread &quot;main&quot;
     java.lang.NullPointerException
         at ZeroDemo1.main(ZeroDemo1.java:72)
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The problem with this program is a rather basic one. The second call of <code>filterData</code> returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 A better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     /*
     if (validcnt == 0) {
         return null;
     }
     */
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 When there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zero-length array is allocated:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     int outdata[] = new int[0];
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 This is perfectly legal Java usage. The representation of Java arrays includes the length of the array, and it's therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 For the <code>ZeroDemo1</code> example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];
     if (validcnt == 0) {
         return outdata;
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 Note that usage such as:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     int outdata[] = new int[]{};
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 is also legal, to initialize an array with a zero-length set of integer constants.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 In general, it's best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. Always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. If you anticipate that your methods will often return zero-length arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. In this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     private static final int ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAY[] = 
                                             new int[0];
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 This array is immutable (it can't be changed), and can be shared throughout your application.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 There's another way that zero-length arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
     
     public class ZeroDemo2 {
         public static void main(String args[]) {
     
             // set up ArrayList and add strings to it
     
             List stringlist = new ArrayList();
             stringlist.add(&quot;string 1&quot;);
             stringlist.add(&quot;string 2&quot;);
             stringlist.add(&quot;string 3&quot;);
     
             // convert to String array
     
             String out[] = (
                           String[])stringlist.toArray(
             new String[0]);
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; out.length; i++) {
                 System.out.println(out[i]);
             }
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The result of running the <code>ZeroDemo2</code> program is:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     string 1
     string 2
     string 3
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The <code>ZeroDemo2</code> program sets up an <code>ArrayList</code>, and adds three strings to it. Then the program calls <code>toArray</code> to get a <code>String</code> array of the three elements in the <code>ArrayList</code>. In this example, the argument to <code>toArray</code> is &quot;new String[0]&quot;. This argument serves a couple of purposes. First, if you have a <code>String</code> array that's big enough to hold the elements of the <code>ArrayList</code>, you can specify it as the argument to <code>toArray</code>. The method will use the <code>String</code> array.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 But if your array is not big enough, then the <code>toArray</code> method allocates an array to return the elements. It uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array. <code>ArrayList</code> stores its element references in an <code>Object</code> array. The <code>toArray</code> method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as String) to be used for returning the array of elements. The method uses reflection (<code>java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance</code>) to create an array of the appropriate type.

282,"Subject: [Spambayes] Deployment
","I think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all
 Python platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.
 
 Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that's unlikely
 to offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even
 L|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to
 their MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)
 
 My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a
 client-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm only
 going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams
 the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The
 MUA accesses this ""eThunk"" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is
 retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual
 oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)
 and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA
 fetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am not
 clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.
 
 Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all
 MUAs can split the host fetch/send URL's
 
 IMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If
 this is available, the ""simple viewer"" could be enhanced to support viewing
 via folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would
 use this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best
 n-way classifier uses something called a ""Support Vector Machine"" (SVM)
 which is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).
 
 I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves
 the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could
 be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user's situation.

 BUSH COVERS THE WATERFRONT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 It may seem like all Iraq, all the time in the Oval Office, but
 the president has at least one other thing on his mind this
 week: that pesky port lockout. The freight still isn't moving,
 factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and
 retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing
 day. 
 
 On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to 
 see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this 
 isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one 
 day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the
 next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the
 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work
 for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the
 disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages.
 
 Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or
 safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao
 covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work
 stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew 
 Iraq would be in here somewhere). ""Union officials quickly
 responded that their members have been unloading military cargo
 throughout the 10-day shutdown,"" said the L.A. Times, but an
 anonymous Bush administration official ""said that only a portion 
 of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore.""
 
 Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley
 would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the
 other hand, ""Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the
 increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in
 polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political
 danger to the Republican administration,"" said the San Francisco 
 Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll
 reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the 
 economy. ""Though the administration promised an unbiased
 examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his
 mind that it was hurting national security and the economy,
 andmerited federal intervention,"" said the AP. 
 
 As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor
 disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers
 simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case).
 One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers'
 contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78
 days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer

 THE BIGGEST CABLE HOOKUP
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 wo birds want to join forces and the FCC is about to cry ""fowl."" 
 We mean ""foul."" The two dominant direct broadcast satellite
 players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big
 Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice
 Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of
 DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite 
 service in the US.
 
 The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed
 merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- 
 it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and
 $25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as 
 some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents,
 and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV
 and EchoStar is Dish. All straight?
 
 The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold
 off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice
 Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified
 ""major revisions"" to the deal that they want to discuss with
 Justice in the next weeks.
 
 The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those
 revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies
 to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted 
 to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the 
 cable company's plans and past spending on such a project.
 
 TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for
 investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for
 expanded-service television may be nearing saturation.
 TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded,
 ""Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but
 shareholders may realize much smaller returns.""
 
 The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch 
 waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for
 DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If the
 current deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith Dawson

 					<P>It may seem like all Iraq, all the time in the Oval Office, but the president has at least one other thing on his mind this week: that pesky port lockout. The freight still isn't moving, factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day. </P><P>
 On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax
 dosages.</P><P>
 Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere). ""Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10-day shutdown,"" said the L.A. Times, but an anonymous Bush administration official ""said that only a portion of
 what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore.""</P><P>
 Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the other hand, ""Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration,"" said the San Francisco Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the
 economy. ""Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention,"" said the AP. </P><P>
 As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers' contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78 days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>

 					<P>wo birds want to join forces and the FCC is about to cry ""fowl."" We mean ""foul."" The two dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite service in the US.</P><P>
 The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and $25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents, and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish. All straight?</P><P>
 The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified ""major revisions"" to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeks.</P><P>
 The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company's plans and past spending on such a project.</P><P>
 TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for expanded-service television may be nearing saturation. TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded, ""Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but shareholders may realize much smaller returns.""</P><P>
 The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If the current deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith Dawson</P><P>

284,"Subject: APT, gcc-3.2-0.1
","Hiya folks,
 
 I'm currently running RawHide, since I had the brilliant idea that, by
 using APT, it might actually be practical to keep up with the
 developments.
 
 However, APT seems to want a recompile - its sometimes leaving the RPM
 database in need of a db_recover - and gcc 3.2 seems to require a closer
 adherence to the standard than the C++ in APT was written for.
 
 This is a bit of a bummer.
 
 Does anyone know if there's a latest version I could try which might
 work, or whether I should simply do the porting myself? (I've made a
 start, but there's a fair amount of work to do.)
 
 If this works out, I might start a repository for the freshrpms compiled
 on vLatest RawHide, for my own purposes and anyone else who's
 interested.
 
 Dave.

 Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulation
 
 By Dan Gillmor
 Mercury News Technology Columnist
 
 The facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy
 industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify
 soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.
 
 Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial
 and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what
 everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.
 
 The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal
 administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed
 supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after
 California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity
 generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,
 also driving up prices.
 
 And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked
 the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a
 memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to
 relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any
 congestion.''
 
 How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be
 seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and
 policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.
 
 More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --
 including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers'
 grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think
 that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least
 favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of
 traditional, non-renewable energy sources.
 
 If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any
 fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the
 state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a
 reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.
 
 State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.
 Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if
 it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the
 utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,''
 notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for
 Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).
 
 It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities --
 tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could
 achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better
 job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to
 inject real competition into the market.
 
 We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity
 defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation
 is essential.
 
 But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers
 control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of
 both.
 
 The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up
 the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities
 will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable
 sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.
 
 But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer
 model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer
 ideas isn't enough.
 
 The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small
 generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized,
 harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is
 coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.
 
 Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all.
 California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax
 incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't
 done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did
 react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's
 lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it
 altogether.
 
 Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so
 grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are
 making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming
 war in Iraq goes badly.
 
 It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to
 drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy
 system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its
 own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it
 hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next
 year.

 Do I get beaten round the head for saying ""floppy""?
 Assuming the machines are networked, let each one send a copy of its kernel to
 the others.  If the drives are open-the-box-and-switch-cables, then you can
 start dd'ing a floppy before you start.  If the drives are in drawers, then this
 might slow you down by all of 60 seconds.
 
 Alternatively, you could use netboot.  No, I'm serious.  Set the boot sequence
 to first hard disk then network.  Do NOT make any partition on the standby
 active.  Have a look at the etherboot package.  One of the things it contains is
 a pascal-ish language for writing boot menus.  You can write a one-liner that
 basically says ""boot /dev/hda1"" (or whatever, there's example code).  IIRC, the
 resulting ""bootable image"" is a whopping 4K.  The downside is you'll need a
 bootp and tftp server somewhere....
 
 hth,
 Ronan.

295,"Subject: Record industry defends practices to Senate
","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85513221
 Date: Not supplied
 
 The Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the 
 Entertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists' claims that 
 the labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day's 
 findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: 
 
     By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to 
     third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, 
     consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently 
     this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the 
     initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief 
     Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA 
     members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared 
     information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but 
     supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared 
     his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the 
     hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for ""Hell Freezes 
     Over,"" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no 
     more than a 10% ""reserve"" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had 
     held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) 
     and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they 
     had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.

 Hmmm, know what? On http://lists.freshrpms.net/ the apt-list has been up
 for a while now ;-) There is almost no traffic though, since I wanted to
 keep that list for apt-rpm on the server side (mirrors, building
 repositories etc.), but hey, it could be a good place for general apt-rpm
 questions ;-)

303,"Subject: [ILUG] Strange ssh problem
","I have a strange problem with one user in a small network using ssh.
 Everyone in the network uses ssh and they run an ssh-agent on login. This
 works fine for conveniently wandering around the network and to some of our
 external boxes - or did, until today. Suddenly, when one user (alfred) tries
 to ssh anywhere he's asked for a password. He says He changed nothing (don't
 they all) but I do actually believe him. I used ssh-keygen to make new keys
 but that didn't help. 
 
 I created a new user alfio into whose home directory I copied alfred's .ssh
 directory - alfio can wander around free as a bird without being asked for a
 password ever (except of course for the passphrase to load the identiy into
 the agent).
 
 In case there was something else in Alfred' environment, I copied .??* from
 alfred's home directory to alfio's, remembering to change ownership
 afterwards. Still alfio is as free as a bird.
 
 We use only SSH2 with DSA keys. An extract from a ssh -v for alfio is below
 
 debug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT
 debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password
 debug1: next auth method to try is publickey
 debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa
 debug1: input_userauth_pk_ok: pkalg ssh-dss blen 434 lastkey 0x80916f0 hint -1
 debug1: ssh-userauth2 successful: method publickey
 
 and before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfio said:
 
 1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA)
 
 whereas with alfred the same segment of the debug log went
 
 debug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT
 debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password
 debug1: next auth method to try is publickey
 debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /nfshome/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa
 debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password
 
 and before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfred said:
 
 1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA)
 
 
 This problem is definitely related to alfred as a user - it happens when he
 logs in on differing workstations (all NFS mounting the same home
 directories) and the other users (including good old alfio) don't have any
 problems.

 * Come work on Thinking in Java in Crested Butte
 * Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 Imminent
 * Thinking in C++, Volume 2, Revision 6 Available
 * Thinking in Java Hands-on Seminar, Bay Area, November
 * Java2 Enterprise Programming Seminar, Bay Area, November

 See the Calendar for the current schedule:
 http://www.mindview.net/Calendar
 
 ===================================
 * Come work on Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, in Crested Butte
 
 All but one of the Interns has departed (he's staying through
 December) and we have empty rooms in the condo that I rented in Mt.
 Crested Butte for the Interns to stay in. If you'd like to
 volunteer to come up (Crested Butte is gorgeous in late
 Summer/early Fall, with excellent hiking and mountain biking), stay
 in the condo, and help work on the 3rd edition of Thinking in Java,
 please email Sharlynn@Mindview.net with your resume and
 availability dates (note that the book is due at the end of
 October). There will be a technical and writing test, and
 interviews to reveal how well you self-motivate and work with
 others.
 
 This should be a great learning experience and a fun time.
 
 ===================================
 * Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 Imminent
 
 The second revision will be up on the site soon, at:
 http://64.78.49.204/
 
 The biggest change is that I've rewritten significant part of the
 multithreading chapter (although it still has a ways to go). The
 goal is to rewrite the chapter to introduce the essence of
 threading with simplicity, and without GUI examples (this
 simplifies things, and allows threads to appear before GUIs).
 
 The chapters have also been reorganized into something like their
 final form, although the final chapter numbering hasn't been done
 yet. We have made more progress in the testing system.
 
 Other details of the changes made in the new version will be at the
 beginning of the book.
 
 The book is due at the end of October. The print version will
 appear in December.
 
 ===================================
 * Thinking in C++, Volume 2, Revision 9 Available tomorrow
 
 Available at:
 http://64.78.49.204/
 
 Chapters 1-4 are finished
 
 ===================================
 * Thinking in Java Hands-on Seminar
 November 4th-8th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.
 Registration opens on September 4th.
 http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/ThinkingInJava/
 
 Created by Bruce Eckel, taught by Andrea Provaglio. We believe this
 is the best in-depth introduction to Java that you'll find.  It's
 based on the book ""Thinking in Java,"" which was created as the
 seminar evolved.
 
 Please note the early registration discount: 
 * $1,600 for payments received by October 12th
 * $1,950 for payments received after October 12th
 
 ===================================
 * Java2 Enterprise Programming Seminar
 November 18th-22th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.
 Registration opens on September 4th.
 http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/J2EE/
 
 Created and taught by Andrea Provaglio, this seminar introduces you
 to the practical development of real-world, Web-enabled,
 distributed applications with Java. It covers J2EE and its key
 technologies: Enterprise JavaBeans, Servlets, Java ServerPages, and
 the basic architectural patterns used to combine these technologies
 into maintainable applications. 
 
 Andrea has been teaching this course in the US and in Europe for
 the last two years, and he has recently restructured and updated
 the seminar to include the latest J2EE features.
 
 You'll come out of this course with a comprehensive understanding
 of the J2EE architecture, of the problems that it is designed to
 solve, how to select the most appropriate tools, and how to code
 your solutions.
 
 Please note the early registration discount: 
 * $1,700 for payments received by October 26th
 * $2,300 for payments received after October 26th
 
 ===================================
 * New seminars
 
 Bill Venners and I just finished giving the last ""Objects &
 Patterns"" seminar, and everyone (especially us) had a great time.
 
 We are now beginning to work towards the two new seminars spawned
 by Objects & Patterns, which Bill and I plan to teach together:
 Design Patterns in Java
 (Drawing primarily from ""Thinking in Patterns"")
 
 Designing Objects & Systems
 This will include a lot of material from Bill's upcoming book on
 Object Design, along with coverage of UML, XP, Object-Oriented
 Design techniques and guidelines, and of course exercises and
 projects.
 
 We hope to begin teaching the courses early next year. Stay tuned.
 
 ===================================
 * Limited Number of Signed Copies of TIJ2 for sale
 
 I'm selling the last 17 of my author copies of Thinking in Java,
 2nd edition. I've signed each one and drawn a little cartoon with
 the signature (the books are in La Mesa, and I'm in Crested Butte,
 so unfortunately I can't personalize them). The cost in the USA is
 $40, which includes handling and mailing. Outside the USA, you'll
 have to email to the address below to find out the additional
 shipping cost.
 
 To order, divide your credit card number (Visa, MC, Amex) into two
 different emails (not high security, but highly likely to be safe),
 and include your credit card billing address and expiration date.
 Email your order to:
 Wayne@MindView.net
 Wayne will email you back to clarify any necessary details.

 GNU/DEVELOPMENT, INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT GNU/LINUX
 
 >From Frederick Noronha
 
 INDIA: There's good news round the corner -- international organisations and
 prominent networks worldwide are waking up to the rich potential of
 Free/Open Source Software, a field that is slowly being recognised for the
 immense promise it holds out to the Third World.
 
 But can this be tapped speedily enough and effectively? 
 
 >From the Unesco to the World Bank, and other global organisations, all are
 catching up on the potential of using GNU/Linux as a potent tool in working
 towards development. More so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial
 office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's
 earnings.
 
 United Nation's Development Programme's Ms. Radhika Lal
 <radhika.lal@undp.org>, a Information-Communication Technology Policy
 Advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on Open Source for
 E-Government. It is to be held in Washington, DC on October 17-18.
 
 infoDev, the Cyberspace Policy Institute of The George Washington
 University, and the UNDP are jointly behind this event. It is intended to
 draw participants from local, national and international organizations from
 both the public and private sector.
 
 This meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness
 about the potential of open source and free software for e-governance. More
 importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors,
 users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in Open Source,
 e-Government and related fields.
 
 Ms Lal works at the ICT-for-Development's Special Initiative Bureau for
 Development Policy at the UNDP's East 45th Street offices in New York.
 
 ICT-for-development is a campaign to use more of infotech and the Internet
 for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy.
 But despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the GNU/Linux world,
 so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles.
 
 See http://www.egovos.org/
 
 OTHER ARMS OF THE U.N.
 ======================
 
 Besides, the UNDP, other arms of the United Nations are also known to be
 showing increasing interest in the potential of free software/open source
 tools. 
 
 Paris-headquartered Unesco (United Nations Education, Scientific and
 Cultural Organisation) recently launched its own Free Software portal. 
 
 It's at http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft.
 
 UNESCO's Jean-Claude Dauphin <jc.dauphin@unesco.org> of the Information
 Society Division also announced that this international organisation has
 been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the Free Software
 movement in relation with UNESCO fields of competence -- education, science
 and culture.
 
 It zeroed in particularly on those coming from the Third World (also called
 the 'South' countries) who could could make propositions for ""revising,
 updating and extending the UNESCO Free Software Portal"" as well as for
 including new basic documents. 
 
 ""This work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can
 be discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,""
 said Dauphin.

 UNESCO Free Software Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft/)
 UNESCO Observatory on the Information Society (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/observatory/)
 
 NEW TOOLS FOR CDS/ISIS
 ======================
 
 Recently, Unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange
 from and to its CDS/ISIS software. These two new tools -- ImpExp2709 and
 IsisAscii v 0.92 -- have recently been released for data exchange from and
 to UNESCO's software package CDS/ISIS. 
 
 CDS/ISIS is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is
 freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within
 the Third World. The new utilities have been released with their source code
 (GPL license). 
 
 See http://www.unesco.org/webworld/news/2002/020806_isis.shtml
 
 Meanwhile, UNDP's APDIP (Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme)
 based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously
 about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, GNU/Linux and
 related issues.
 
 ""We want to see how we can further this cause in the region,"" APDIP's Shahid
 Akhtar told this correspondent.
 
 Niranjan Rajani <niranjan.rajani@maailma.net>, of Pakistani origin but based
 in the birthplace of Linux, Finland, is now working on a research project on
 ""Significance of Free/OpenSource Software for Developing Countries"".
 
 This project is financed by the Finnish Foreign Ministry, and he has
 undertaken to write the paper by the end of November this year, for
 Maailma.Net, a local division of OneWorld.Net.
 
 This project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use
 of FS/OSS, especially some of its most significant and popular projects;
 GNU/Linux, Apache, Mozilla, OpenOffice etc. in the developing or Third World
 countries. It will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies
 and lives of these countries.
 
 CONVINCING GOVERNMENTS
 ======================
 
 In India, organisations like Red Hat have been putting out slick
 presentations to convince governments and officials to try out Open Source. 
 
 Shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. That's
 the message that governments across India were recently with, as official
 computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and
 speedy software-fuelled hardware obsolence.
 
 Senior IT and e-governance officials from across the country tuned in
 attentively during a recent seminar in Goa, as executives from computing
 giant IBM and leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India narrated long
 lists of benefits that governments could get from going the Linux way.
 
 Pointing to examples from across the globe, Red Hat India argued that the US
 Department of Energy has built supercomputers on GNU/Linux, the Chinese are
 making Linux the official server operating system -- to be widely used in
 varsities, military installations and within government. 
 
 Some months back, an organisation under India's Ministry of Information
 Technology -- called the ER&DCI (Electronics Research and Development Centre
 of India) -- entered into a strategic alliance with leading Linux systems
 supplier Red Hat India to popularize the 'open source' solution in the
 government sector.
 
 On networks like the EDC/World Bank-support GKD (Global Knowledge for
 Development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the
 news.
 
 GNU/Linux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed
 out. (See http://www.lincproject.org)

 Law Center has helped many low-income led organizing groups acquire access
 to the Internet and use technology more effectively,"" says Dirk Slater
 <dirk@welfarelaw.org>. 
 
 While these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one
 another and their allies by using the Internet, one communication hurdle
 remains -- communicating with their leadership via the Internet. 
 
 Despite many ""digital divide"" initiatives addressing access to the Internet
 in low-income communities, access is still an issue. 
 
 Public Internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not
 sufficient, as Slater has pointed out. Many low-income leaders do not have
 access to the Internet where it would make the most impact -- in their
 homes. 
 
 LINC argues that the need for Internet communication is particularly great
 for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent
 face-to-face meetings because of distance, time and money constraints.
 
 ""We began to explore the idea of using Linux, a free operating system that
 works well on older computers, when we learned of Microsoft's decision to
 discontinue support of its older operating systems like Windows 95<
 according to Slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the Low-Income
 Networking and Communications (LINC) Project at the Welfare Law Center.
 
 LINC protagonists say they had also been ""troubled"" by the frequent problems
 that occur for Windows users just by having Windows run on its own. ""Giving
 a person who lives in a rural area an older computer with Windows seemed
 like we were just asking for trouble. We also attempted to identify similar
 projects but had limited success,"" says Slater. 
 
 LINC wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using
 donated computers for board members and leaders of low-income led
 organizations that LINC serves. 
 
 ""Our goal is to increase the ability of LINC Project partner groups to use
 open-source software to support their organizing work. We also wanted to
 document the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide
 details of our experiences for others doing similar projects,"" LINC
 explains.
 
 LINC identified a partner in Grass Roots Organizing in Mexico, MO, and
 installed GNU/Linux on 10 computers used as stand-alone workstations in
 people's homes. GNU/Linux was also installed on a brand new stand-alone
 computer to work as the main computer in the GRO office.
 
 Links were built with the Mizzou Linux Users Group for ongoing local
 support.
 
 ""We still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely
 successful project. After a period of a few months we will assess whether
 the board members are actually using the computers to communicate more
 effectively,"" said Slater.

 Bala Pillai <bala@tamil.net>, who was earlier based in Malaysia and now in
 Sydney-Australia, is founder of Tamil Innaiyam (http://www.tamil.net), an
 organisation to promote the Tamil language worldwide. He points to the
 impact GNU/Linux is making in some distant areas of the Third World.
 
 Says Pillai: ""The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time
 zone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino
 psyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident psyche. 
 
 ""Folks who are self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more
 time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and re-echoing it.
 Filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing -- we should look to
 more symbiosis with them,"" says he. 
 
 Pillai also notes that the Manila-based Miguel Paraz, whom he interacted
 with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community.
 ""http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key
 Open Source catalysts in the Philippines,"" says he. 
 
 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is
 another lead Open Source catalyst from the region, explains Pillai. ""Do look
 for symbiosis opportunities there too,"" he suggests. 
 
 ""I see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. For example, there is
 likely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or
 publicizing where there is over-duplication. If we coordinated ourselves and
 found out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this
 work and get fruits out faster,"" he adds.

 Subject: Attn programmers: support offered [FLOSS-Sarai Initiative]
 Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:45 GMT
 
 Dear friends,
 
 Can we manage to get some money into backing Free/Libre Open Source
 Software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to
 support their cash-strapped initiatives? 
 
 Sarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study
 of Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea.
 
 Jeebesh Bagchi <jeebesh@sarai.net> sent in this offer recently. It could
 surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to
 make a break in Free Software/Open Source, but hamstrung by resources. 
 
 It might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely 
 workable, I guess. This is my own gut-level feeling, but maybe bigger
 initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. If
 such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for
 greater support to free software/open source developers in regions like
 ours. --FN

","Good idea!
 
 This could also be a job for P2P; lots of people would love to
 devote their spare cycles, bandwidth, and unblocked IP addresses
 to giving the Chinese unfettered net access.
 
 In a sense, this is what the ""peek-a-booty"" project does:
 
    http://www.peek-a-booty.org
 
 But let's play out the next few moves:
 
 Good Guys: Google enables SSL access
  Bad Guys: Chinese government again blocks all access to Google domains
 Good Guys: Set up Google proxies on ever-changing set of hosts (peek-a-booty)
  Bad Guys: Ban SSL (or any unlicensed opaque traffic) at the national firewall
 Good Guys: Hide Google traffic inside other innocuous-looking activity
  Bad Guys: Require nationwide installation of client-side NetNannyish
            software
 Good Guys: Offer software which disables/spoofs monitoring software
  Bad Guys: Imprison and harvest organs from people found using
            monitoring-disabling-software
 
 ...and on and on.
 
 The best we can hope is that technological cleverness, by raising the
 costs of oppression or by provoking intolerable oppression, brings
 social liberalization sooner rather than later.

 Subject: How about subsidizing SSL access to Google?
 
 
 [a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the
 article I was commenting on... Rohit]
 
 In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The
 Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most
 subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which
 merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By
 maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web,
 if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.
 
 The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce
 these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from
 Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all
 Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
 encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to
 SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle;
 censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in
 China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of
 IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in
 the article.
 
 Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic
 costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free
 flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors
 sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest
 of the Web?
 
 To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector
 programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just
 imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure
 access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom
 of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most
 of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.
 
 On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting*
 the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...
 
 Best,
    Rohit Khare
 
 ===========================================================
 
 The search goes on
 China backtracks on banning Googleup to a point
 
 Sep 19th 2002 | BEIJING
  From The Economist print edition
 
 IN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine,
 is gougou, meaning doggy. For the country's fast-growing population of
 Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving
 an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked
 access to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaapparently
 because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to
 forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been
 restored.
 
 An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More
 sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to
 use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government.
 Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by
 Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for
 Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.
 
 After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users
 posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move.
 Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet
 providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site
 to far less powerful search engines in China.
 
 Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm,
 BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to
 censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking
 individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be
 filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key
 words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this
 week when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on
 Google for Falun Gonga quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China
 usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search
 also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.

 I think perhaps you missed the fact that SA scores are adjustable.  If
 you want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put this
 in your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.
 
   score RAZOR_CHECK 10
 
 The default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5.
 Therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA
 then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5
 would be sufficient.
 
 If you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient.
 Otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once
 for SA and once again afterward.  If you really want to run Razor
 individually then you should set the 'score RAZOR_CHECK 0' so that SA
 won't do it and avoid the double network hit.
 
 However, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has
 been the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  The
 current score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam.
 But for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold.
 Razor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide
 of use as Razor1.

 Or we could have the audacity to tell them to shape up or get cut out 
 of the global marbles game. Unfortunately that model only seems to 
 apply to despots with oil and WMDs, rather than despots with WMDs.

 Brothel duty for Australian MP
 
 A conservative Member of Parliament in Australia is set to 
 spend the day as a ""slave"" at one of Western Australia's most 
 notorious brothels. 
 
 Liberal Party member Barry Haase was ""won"" in a charity auction 
 after the madam of Langtree's brothel in the mining town of 
 Kalgoorlie made the highest offer for his services for a day. 
 
 [...]
 
 ""I hope he will leave with an informed decision on what 
 Australian brothels are all about and it will help him in his 
 political career to make informed decisions that he might not 
 have been able to make before,"" Ms Kenworthy said. 
 
 Mr Haase, a member of Prime Minister John Howard's party 
 seemed relaxed about the prospect of working in a brothel. 
 
 ""You can't be half-hearted about fundraising for significant 
 charities and I think I'm big enough to play the game,"" he said.

326,"Subject: From
","
 When I receive a message that has a line starting with ""From "", it's
 broken into two messages.  I get my mail from /var/spool/mail.  The
 program that incorporates mail thinks that the ""From "" line starts a new
 message.
 
 My sysadmins have told me that the sending mail client is supposed to 
 escape lines begining with ""From "".  EXMH (2.5) doesn't do this.  Should 
 it?  It appears that my MH is MH 6.8.  Does NMH fix this?

 Ah, sorry for not making that clearer.
 But no.
 Previously (v1.0.6 of GnuPG) there would be a slight pause at this point while
 it went out to get the public key from a keyserver.
 Now, whether I have the key or NOT, I get the failure message.
 
 Its as if it cant find gpg to execute it (but I fixed that path), so there
 must be something else that I am missing...

 Nice to hear that somebody else does this too.

","draw the pain
 
 ""Ken never wrote about this method, but he often demonstrated it in
 workshops. Let us say you have a physical pain somewhere in your body. You
 draw the pain in the air with your finger, about 30 cm (1 foot) high. Take
 about 60 seconds to trace around the perimeter of the pain, carefully
 listening to the pain to find the precise boundary between where it hurts
 and where it does not. Repeat. You will find that after about 10 minutes of
 this the pain will shift, shrink or disappear. A variant of this is to
 imagine making a 3D model the pain in coloured clay.""
 
 Works!  There's this coworker - a real pain in my ass!  I used my middle
 finger to trace his outline for about 60 seconds.  I listened to him, found
 the boundary, and repeated the motion.  He left my office!

 Subject: Living Love - Another legacy of the 60's
 
 
 Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated
 with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be
 the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but
 related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"",
 hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I
 obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo /
 G-Force Dyno-Staff.
 
 I have to say however that, having found this while looking for
 something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I
 particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the
 Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.
 
 To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular
 seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some
 religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very
 irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and
 contrast with our (my) modern mental models.
 
 I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and
 justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.

 We create the world we live in.
 A loving person lives in a loving world,
 A hostile person lives in a hostile world.
 Everyone you meet is your mirror.
 
 You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence
 as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to
 waste what you do have.
 
 The past is dead,
 The future is imaginary,
 Happiness can only be
 in the Eternal Now Moment
 
 How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the
 direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.
 
 Love a person because he or she is there.
 This is the only reason.
 
 Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions
 and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.
 
 The
 purpose
 of our lives
 is to be free
 of all addictive traps,
 and thus
 become one
 with the ocean of
 Living Love.

334,"Subject: Never pay eBay listing fees again!
","Hi,
 
 I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
 I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
 $250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?
 
 In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
 it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...
 
 You've probably heard stories about people making
 whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
 were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
 boy-geniuses.
 
 Well, grasshopper, think again ...
 
 It's people like you and me that are making the real
 money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!
 
 Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
 entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.
 
 Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
 like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
 financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
 work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
 technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.
 
 If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
 you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
 DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
 You might not want their product, but remember that 
 thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
 percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
 makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
 guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
 review some numbers ...
 
 If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
 dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
 auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
 couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
 over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
 SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
 at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
 emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
 ZERO!
 
 Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
 hardly anyone sees your ad!
 
 Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
 profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
 an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
 in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
 generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
 of work.  
 
 It's that simple ...
 
 All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
 THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.
 
 The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
 matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
 using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
 executive working from an office building in New 
 York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
 bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
 it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
 and some basic familiarity with the Internet.
 
 I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
 ""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
 started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
 the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
 opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
 I bought my own home - with CASH.  
 
 You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
 You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
 whatsoever is required.  
 
 If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
 you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
 So what are you waiting for?!
 
 I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
 YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
 will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.
 
 Here goes ...
 
 Do you have basic experience with the web? 
 Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
 Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
 Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
 complete financial freedom?  
 
 If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
 making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
 home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
 the 9-5 daily grind!
 
 All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
 is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
 to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
 it.
 
 You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
 Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
 how to start your first email campaign and how to
 build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
 orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.
 
 Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?
 
 No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
 products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
 starting an Internet business because they have 
 nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
 After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
 product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
 not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
 seven days. In fact ...
 
 I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
 bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
 the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
 to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
 where else will you find that level of service?!
 
 I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
 your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
 Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
 routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
 instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
 example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
 The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
 list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
 very first campaign is ready to go.
 
 As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
 of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
 email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
 include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE

 classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
 never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
 on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
 What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
 to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
 you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
 extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 
 
 Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.

 Bomber targets Dutch Ikea stores
 
 Police in the Netherlands are searching all 10 outlets of the Ikea furniture
 chain in the country, after finding bombs in two stores.
 The devices were discovered in Amsterdam and Sliedrecht, near the port city
 of Rotterdam on Tuesday evening.
 The Sliedrecht bomb exploded at a police station, injuring two policeman.
 Police have also closed off a motorway section in the central city Utrecht,
 near a third IKEA store where a suspicious package was found.
 No information about the motive behind the attacks has been released.
 ""We decided together with the police because of safety reasons that the
 company's stores in the Netherlands would be closed today,"" said Ikea
 spokeswoman Helen van Trearum.
 ""We don't want to take any risks. We are taking this very seriously,"" she
 added.
 Ikea - a Swedish-based group - is one of the world's largest furniture
 retailers, with stores in more than 30 countries.
 Meanwhile, the Amsterdam head office of the Dutch news agency ANP was
 evacuated on Wednesday, after police warned that a bomb might have been
 planted in the building.

 It seems implausible to me that ""shiver"" here means ""to shake""; I don't
 recall seeing the word used transitively in that sense, and web1913
 lists that sense as ""v. i."", or intransitive.  The transitive sense of
 ""shiver"", which we no longer use but which people used widely in the
 1800s (web1913 doesn't even list it as archaic or obsolete), means
 ""to shatter into splinters, normally with a blow"".
 
 Shivering a boat's timbers, of course, leaves you with no boat.
 (Shivering some of them, which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough,
 leaves you with a sinking boat.)
 
 So, ""Shiver my timbers if I do,"" can be reasonably interpreted as a more
 vivid way of saying, ""May I die suddenly if I do.""  The interpretation
 suggested by Quinion, ""May my boat be damaged,"" neither makes as much
 sense in context nor obeys the normal rules of grammar.
 
 I've sent a copy of this to Quinion.

 FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
 his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.
 
 This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
 them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
 Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
 substantial income.
 
 Heres the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
 another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
 BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
 SHOCKING FACTS:
 
 a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
 b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
 c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
 d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
 you how to collect the judgment. 
 
 All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
 must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
 accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
 has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
 BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
 expense instead of an asset!  
 
 WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
 files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
 United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
 uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
 5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. 
 
 So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
 other peoples judgments?  Thats what we want to tell you.  
 Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
 process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
 into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.
 
 The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
 techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
 making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
 associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
 year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
 organizations.
 
 Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
 over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
 new judgments become available every day.  The work is
 ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
 This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
 something on the side that will offer a solid income in the future. 
 It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
 spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
 A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
 The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
 want to make!

 to do. This business lets you control your destiny! You dont need

 Japanese toilet technology has developed creeping featuritis. New Tokyo toities 
 sport speech-recognition, air-conditioning, and body-chemistry monitors: 
 
     Japan's toilet wars started in February, when Matsushita engineers here 
     unveiled a toilet seat equipped with electrodes that send a mild electric 
     charge through the user's buttocks, yielding a digital measurement of 
     body-fat ratio. 
 
     Unimpressed, engineers from a rival company, Inax, counterattacked in April 
     with a toilet that glows in the dark and whirs up its lid after an infrared 
     sensor detects a human being. When in use, the toilet plays any of six 
     soundtracks, including chirping birds, rushing water, tinkling wind chimes, 
     or the strumming of a traditional Japanese harp.

 FWIW, I would now recommend doing this (using a user with a procmailrc)
 instead of a system alias; more secure, and easier to filter out crud
 like bounces, virii etc. that render a corpus dirty.

 Generally,someone is attempting to preserve a relationship with this 
 nonsense, when quite plainly the the relationship is in a state where 
 preserving it is of little value.  Hardware is of no real use save for 
 playing the power-struggle game.   I don't want to see the future of this.

 It seems so automatic for people to reach for coercive solutions.   So 
 surprizing given the low absolute effectiveness of coercion in the absense 
 of overwhelming force advantage.

 THE CHAIRMAN	
 by NICHOLAS LEMANN
 He's the other Powell, and no one is sure what he's up to.
 New Yorker, October 8, 2002
 
 Last year, my middle son, in eighth grade and encountering his first 
 fairly serious American-history course, indignantly reported that the 
 whole subject was incomprehensible. I was shocked. What about Gettysburg 
 and the Declaration of Independence and the Selma-to-Montgomery march? 
 Just look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His 
 class had got up to the eighteen-forties. What I expected was a big 
 beefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, 
 there was some of that. But the main difference between my son's text 
 and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous 
 decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American 
 history. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and 
 reciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping 
 for easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation 
 of freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it 
 become possible to see the federal government's main function as 
 responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, 
 instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic 
 interests.
 
 Even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty 
 speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you'd find 
 is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so 
 much over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real 
 estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which 
 this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and 
 commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It's 
 an insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because 
 the public and the pressencouraged by the players, who speak in jargon
 can't get themselves interested.
 
 One corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal 
 Communications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand 
 denizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate 
 commerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that 
 the commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription 
 price: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they 
 grumblingly attend the Chairman's Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where 
 the high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating 
 comedy routine by the commission's chairman.
 
 Of all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that 
 Americans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with 
 a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the 
 American economy, as well as important aspects of daily lifetelephone 
 and television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now 
 F.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, 
 because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the 
 ""corporate scandals"" concerns the economic collapse of companies 
 regulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, 
 among others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is 
 part of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney 
 analyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the 
 embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the 
 past two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions 
 of dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a 
 dead weight pulling down the entire stock market.
 
 This year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state 
 of the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes 
 F.C.C. World's feverish mood (""The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns"") 
 and suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of 
 the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I 
 just quoted is followed by this explanation: ""The ILECs appear likely to 
 enter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no 
 residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% 
 market share loss in business lines to CLECs."" It's a lot easier to 
 think about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.
 
 
 Even in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the 
 commission's chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially 
 intense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes 
 itself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael 
 Powell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, 
 because he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. 
 Unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which 
 generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about 
 who he really is and what he's really up to. Powell is young to be the 
 head of a federal agencyhe is thirty-nineand genially charming. 
 Everybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years 
 one of the F.C.C.'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the 
 F.C.C.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the 
 arcane details of communications policy. He's always saying that he's an 
 ""avid moderate."" And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his 
 predecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell 
 to Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, 
 calls him ""radical and extreme."" Just as often as he's accused of being 
 a right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically 
 cautious. ""It ain't about singing 'Kum-Ba-Yah' around the campfire,"" 
 another former chairman, William Kennard, says. ""You have to have an 
 answer."" One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate 
 subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the 
 subcommittee's chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated 
 him. ""You don't care about these regulations,"" Hollings said. ""You don't 
 care about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That's the 
 fundamental. That's the misgiving I have of your administration over 
 there. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and 
 seem to not care at all. I think you'd be a wonderful executive 
 vice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a 
 regulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your 
 job?""
 
 ""Extremely,"" Powell said, with an amiable smile.
 
 
 One cannot understand Powell's maddening effect, at least on Democrats 
 and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose 
 of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was 
 created by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the 
 New Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy 
 cases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure 
 that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its 
 other original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, 
 the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers 
 unfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, 
 well-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial 
 supervisionits real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition 
 among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by 
 artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. 
 In addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission 
 more specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many 
 of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most 
 terrifying category of interest groupyou can cross the local bank 
 president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. 
 According to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once 
 blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers 
 in the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the 
 anti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV 
 station in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.
 
 
 F.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, 
 because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic 
 niches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful 
 breakup of A.T. & T.by far the biggest and most important company the 
 commission regulateddeposited a thick additional sediment of 
 self-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation 
 ago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one 
 long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, 
 which customers were not permitted to ownand they were all the same 
 company. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the 
 mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local 
 phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing 
 to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores 
 everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturersand 
 millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the 
 telephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a ""natural 
 monopoly,"" requiring protection from economic competition and total 
 control over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, 
 the F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones 
 and the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: 
 consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more 
 prosperous, too.
 
 The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 
 one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which 
 most people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. 
 Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of 
 modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group 
 bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers 
 as ""baby Bells"" and to F.C.C. World as ""arbocks"" (the pronounced version 
 of RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to 
 offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance 
 companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for 
 customers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would 
 get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more 
 competition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and 
 economics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by 
 Vice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as 
 helping to reposition them as the technology partythe party that 
 brought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of 
 jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose 
 beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's 
 slogans about the ""information superhighway"" and ""building a bridge to 
 the twenty-first century,"" which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully 
 sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical 
 correlates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was 
 supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.
 
 The F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, 
 aggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like 
 all important interest groups they work with both parties); they 
 immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new 
 competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through 
 rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by 
 Reed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep 
 the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies 
 like A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new 
 companies, ""see-lecks"" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive 
 local exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory 
 equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have 
 access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the 
 seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the 
 F.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.
 
 Partly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that 
 he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming 
 condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the 
 see-leckscompanies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligentand 
 into other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related 
 technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom 
 boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks 
 and other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests 
 of the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt's 
 former lieutenants told me, ""Reed used to joke that my job was to make 
 sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.""
 
 
 The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the 
 boom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more 
 startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: 
 Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and 
 Comcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys 
 believed that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative 
 accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so 
 undiscriminating.)
 
 By the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been 
 determined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the 
 chairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of 
 influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. 
 Three Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; 
 Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and 
 Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as 
 such, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most 
 powerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of 
 S.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant 
 that the arbocks didn't want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he 
 might be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy 
 Regulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he 
 wasn't as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative 
 movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than 
 Furchtgott-Roth.
 
 Powell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared 
 before a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and 
 gave a very Michael Powell speechwhimsical, intellectual, and 
 free-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore's Law)that 
 began by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new 
 telecom companies alive. ""In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is 
 often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas,"" Powell said. ""Like the 
 Whos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast 
 beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the 
 deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act's 
 fertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the 
 least, so it is thought."" Thus Powell was indicating that if he became 
 chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as 
 part of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day 
 of the Bush Administration.
 
 Twenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead 
 or dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in 
 serious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite 
 companies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically 
 concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing 
 companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in 
 good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged 
 companies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the 
 financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications 
 industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells 
 wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and 
 if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national 
 duopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. 
 And these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the 
 poor health of the long-distance companies.
 
 The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national 
 companies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they 
 don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more 
 fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. As part 
 of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 
 Telecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were 
 significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of 
 radio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five 
 per cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news 
 programming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary 
 of Viacom.
 
 In this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should 
 be hyperactivethe superhero of government regulation, springing to the 
 rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try 
 to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should 
 disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the 
 forces of concentration. It should use the government's money and muscle 
 to get new technologyespecially fast Internet connectionsinto the 
 homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (An 
 analogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and 
 the Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush 
 people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush 
 people blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many 
 expectations and stirred too many passions.)
 
 But Michael Powell's F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been 
 conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the 
 F.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him 
 signals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of 
 the F.C.C.'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn't mean he has 
 been inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further 
 infuriates his criticsin a manner that smoothly blends the genial and 
 the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of 
 F.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he's 
 having the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, 
 when he was asked what he was going to do about the ""digital 
 divide""that is, economic inequality in access to the Internethe said, 
 ""You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I'd like to have one and 
 I can't afford one."" At the National Cable & Telecommunications 
 Association convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of 
 tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a 
 somersault.
 
 
 Not long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until 
 1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest 
 Washington, near the city's open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at 
 the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody 
 else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building 
 looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. 
 Even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and 
 fluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and 
 walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a 
 jeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because 
 of the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he 
 became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly 
 the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of 
 the market before the fact""prophylactically,"" as he likes to sayshould 
 wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust 
 litigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and 
 then became a protg of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division 
 of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government's 
 legal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of 
 the New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell's political 
 skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush 
 Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but 
 also maintains close ties to Bush's nemesis Senator John McCain, of 
 Arizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his 
 enduring love of law school""It's sort of like a law-school study 
 session over there,"" one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to 
 confirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law 
 students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.
 
 I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions 
 of the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the 
 airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?
 
 ""I think we'll never know,"" Powell said. ""I don't think it's an 
 automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably 
 the best analogue. We don't seize all the land in the United States and 
 say, 'The government will issue licenses to use land.' If my neighbor 
 puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law 
 about what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If 
 a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a 
 similar proposition. There are scholars who argueindeed, the famous 
 Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about thisthat 
 spectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds 
 of ways that we're accustomed to.""
 
 Talking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he 
 doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He 
 slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in 
 ironic air quotes. He's like your libertarian friend in college who 
 enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions 
 about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he 
 sees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he 
 thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications 
 Act had been excessive.
 
 ""I would start with a caveat,"" Powell said. ""Look, I can't fault those 
 judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. 
 They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. 
 But, frankly, I've always been a little bit critical. First of all, 
 anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close 
 to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President 
 on down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. I mean, I 
 don't know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, 
 or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that 
 were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts 
 reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. 
 But, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet 
 excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it 
 certainly was.
 
 ""But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of 
 expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the 
 economy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically 
 exaggerated expectationby the leadership of the commission, by 
 politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a 
 gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones 
 that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to 
 see numbers go up on the board.""
 
 Powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. "" 
 'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see 
 thirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the 
 Bells to bleed! Then we'll know we've succeeded.' "" Now Powell returned 
 to being Powell. ""I think that expectation was astonishingly 
 unrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they're 
 there. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And 
 the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There's no 
 question, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much 
 debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business 
 model.""
 
 How could the Telecom Act have been handled better? ""We could have 
 chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were 
 slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,"" 
 Powell said. ""Money chased what seemed like government-promised 
 opportunity. The problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're 
 in it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This 
 debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some 
 ways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability.""
 
 Powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there 
 had been a more ""reasonable"" level of investment. ""No, we wouldn't have 
 every home in America with competitive choice yetbut we don't anyway. I 
 don't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. I don't buy 
 that. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? The 
 part of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so 
 would MCI WorldCom and Sprint.""
 
 Other local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable 
 businesses, either, and they never might. ""Everybody's always saying, 
 'The regulators did this and this and this.' But, candidly, the story's 
 quite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six 
 years to give them a chance. Conditions don't get that good except once 
 every thirty years, and it didn't happen. So, whatever the reason, we're 
 looking at a WorldCom that's teetering. We're looking at a long-distance 
 business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is 
 breaking itself up. Sprint has struggled.""
 
 Could the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies 
 stronger? ""At the F.C.C.? I think I'll just be blunt. My political 
 answer? Yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try 
 to help. But I can't find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. 
 I can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. 
 investigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don't have 
 those kinds of levers. I don't know whether anybody does. At some point, 
 companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from 
 dying."" Powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think 
 it's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has 
 demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist 
 gesturesin August, for example, five months after disbanding the 
 F.C.C.'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was 
 appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the 
 communications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding 
 out the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities 
 and Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore 
 up the telecom industry.
 
 I asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one 
 company provided cable television and only one provided local phone 
 service. ""Yes,"" he said. ""It concerns us that there's one of each of 
 those things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one 
 of each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications 
 capabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other."" 
 Anyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to 
 provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will 
 provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. 
 ""So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question 
 is, Does it stay that way?""
 
 The concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of 
 information did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that 
 people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, 
 which distorts markets. ""If this were just economics, it's easy. If you 
 were to say to me, 'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we 
 know how to do thatthe econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a 
 market's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is 
 other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take 
 the question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption 
 there is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic 
 viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. I 
 think that's a possibility. I don't think it's nearly the possibility 
 that's ascribed to it sometimes.""
 
 Powell explained, ""Sometimes when we see very pointed political or 
 parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the 
 same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh 
 exists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off 
 the planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, 
 and then we have policies like""here his tone went from ironic to 
 sarcastic""the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis 
 of what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed 
 and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic 
 fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out.""
 
 
 F.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he 
 can't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries 
 he regulatesso he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the 
 market, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he's carrying 
 water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is 
 planning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed 
 Attorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn't want to do anything 
 at the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he's 
 waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, 
 so that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the 
 crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television 
 networks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of 
 Telecom, after Colin Powell's idea that the United States should never 
 commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, 
 and an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he 
 says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and 
 irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.
 
 ""This is why elections matter,"" Reed Hundt, who isn't happy about what 
 has become of his Telecom Act, told me. It's true that the F.C.C.much 
 more than, say, the war in Afghanistanis a case in which a Gore 
 Administration would be acting quite differently from the Bush 
 Administration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but 
 there's no question whether communications companies have noticed. The 
 arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would 
 have done if Gore had won. Next election, they'll help the party that 
 helped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the 
 arbocks' favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks' rivalsthe 
 long-distance companies and the telecommunications upstartswith their 
 friends now in power, will stage a comeback. America's present is not 
 unrecognizably different from America's past.

 Battery pack, huh what???
 
 You dont use batteries for a 1/4 mile run, you use capacitors. MANY times
 the energy density, and you can get the energy out fast enough. Note that
 the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run
 anyway, just like a gas dragster is refueled, so this wouldnt be cheating.
 200 MPH should be no problem.

359,"Subject: Strictly Private.
","Gooday,
 
 With warm heart my friend, I send you my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. 
 
 It will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. 
 
 My name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party,  Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001.
 
 When the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, !
  En!
 gland for 9years now. 
 
 I am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.
 
 If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. 
 
 To legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. 
 
 For valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.
 
 Please, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. 
 
 I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.
 
 Yours sincerely,
 Donald Phiri.

 uh, no, you don't want to make it world-writable.  world-readable.

 Just remember that the .razor and whatever DCC uses needs to be
 world-readable as well.  The solution is then to make a world-writable
 log file for at least Razor.  I like symlinking /dev/null myself.

 efficient?  probably (depends on the user base), but it also takes
 the control away from the user (which may or may not be a good thing,
 depending again on the user base...)

 I'll post my own repository story here anyway, hope no-one minds.
 It may freely be commented on or used in another text.
 
 I have a directory like this:
 $ tree  -d
 .
 |-- current7
 |   |-- SRPMS.current
 |   |-- SRPMS.gcc3
 |   `-- redhat
 |       |-- RPMS.current
 |       |-- RPMS.gcc3
 |       `-- base
 |-- redhat-7_2
 |   |-- SRPMS.os
 |   `-- redhat
 |       |-- RPMS.os -> <link to RH network install image>
 |       `-- base
 `-- testing
     |-- SRPMS.testing
     `-- redhat
         |-- RPMS.testing
         `-- base
 
 27 directories
 
 I throw updates to current7's rpms and my own stuff (with makefile :) to
 testing.
 After each new package, 
 nice genbasedir -s --progress --topdir=$TOPDIR/ \
 testing/redhat testing
 
 (for -s to work, you need to make release files, pinch someones for
 exmple)
 
 This stuff is found under apache. I put that url, my keys and all that
 into apt conf on the machines on the network and apt away.
 
 As for .fi mirrors, funet is very slow. I think I use tuxfamily for
 updates but when I see errata I usually also put that to my own one so
 rest of the machines have a shorter path to it.
 Funet hosts a whole load of mirrors and projects (it used to be (is?)
 the main mirror for Linux. It was one of the big pub ftp sites). If
 there was a definite apt repository, maybe they might mirror that as
 well. I doubt RH would be very keen on using apt and forking a
 distribution doesn't seem like an easy option, someone should just start
 a project.

370,"Subject: [zzzzteana] Compensation for World's youngest mother
","http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/08/26/peru.mother.reut/index.html
 
 LIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina's parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru's Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. 
 
 Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. 
 
 Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. 
 
 At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as ""Little Chicago."" 
 
 Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. 
 
 But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. 
 
 ""The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,"" Jose Sandoval, author of ""Mother Aged 5,"" told Reuters. 
 
 ""We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective,"" he added. 
 
 'Totally willing to help'
 Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. 
 
 ""We're totally willing to help her,"" said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. 
 
 Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. ""She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,"" he said. ""She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true."" 
 
 Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. 
 
 Medical rarity
 No one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. 
 
 One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. 
 
 He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. 
 
 Her swelling stomach worried her parents. ""They thought it was a tumor,"" he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. 
 
 There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. 
 
 Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. 
 
 Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. 
 
 More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. 
 
 One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. 
 
 But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in ""moral danger,"" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. 
 
 But Sandoval said: ""It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them."" 
 
 Happy ending?
 Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. 
 
 Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. 
 
 After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. 
 
 He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. 
 
 Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. 
 
 She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. ""We just want to get on with our lives, that's it,"" said Jurado, adding he thought ""absolutely nothing"" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. 
 
 He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. 
 
 He said its value was ""more or less $25,000"" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. 
 
 ""If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,"" he said. 
 
 As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. ""I believe there will be a happy ending,"" he said. 
 
 ""As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era
 of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the
 country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the
 prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands
 and the Republic is destroyed.""
 Abraham Lincoln (Nov 21, 1864 in a letter to Col. William F Elkins)

","
 You're in luck because my mom sends these all the time and I never
 have anything else to do with them ...
 
  An old man lived alone in Minnesota. He wanted to spade his potato garden,
 but it was very hard work.
  His only son, who would have helped him, was in Prison. The old man  wrote
 a  letter to his son and mentioned his predicament.
  Shortly, he received this reply, ""For heaven's sake Dad, don't dig up  that
 garden, that's where I buried the GUNS!""
  At 4 A.M. the next morning, a dozen police showed up and dug up the old
 man's entire garden, without finding any guns.
  Confused, the old man wrote another note to his son telling him what
 happened, and asking him what to do next.
  His son's reply was: ""Now plant your potatoes, Dad. It's the best
 I could  do  at this time.""

 &check now un-defangs MIME -- it was screwing up some of my mass-check
 results (where SA-markup was present, yes).
 
 If there ever was a warning about SA-markup in mass-check, it never
 worked for me.

 My typical Java-to-C conversion doesn't increase the lines of code by
 more than 20%, and a fair portion of that is the implementation of
 additional features that drove us to do the conversion in the first
 place.  Some things are substantially more succinct when written in C
 than in Java.  C and most other mature languages have an endless
 collection of libraries.  I personally don't use anything beyond the
 core libraries of any language that much though.
 
 On a tangent, I find libraries nearly useless for a great many things
 due primarily to the fact that most of them are so general that a given
 non-trivial API almost always has a context in which it will function in
 a pathological manner.  Code reuse is wonderful and all that, but
 libraries frequently make design trade-offs that won't work for me even
 if they theoretically do exactly what I need.  Unfortunately, it isn't
 particularly easy nor does it make a nice simple API to design a library
 that really is optimizable to a wide range of design cases.  I've built
 a small collection of flexible psuedo-polymorphic APIs over the years
 that I tend to use, but it is a pretty ugly solution for code reuse when
 you get right down to it.

 Microsoft Tuesday said it has purchased a Mountain View, Calif.-based
 security company to better secure its core file services including its
 Windows platform and .NET initiative.
 
 The Redmond, Wash-based software giant has acquired the assets of XDegrees
 for an undisclosed amount of cash and is in the process of relocating the
 team of 12 or 14 engineers to the Microsoft campus.
 
 XDegrees' technology assigns URLs to Word files, video clips, and other
 digital documents for access across a peer-to-peer network
 
 XDegrees founder Michael Tanne was offered a job, but decided instead to
 play his hand in the Silicon Valley.

 ""XDegrees' technology assigns URLs to Word files, video clips, and other
 digital documents for access across a peer-to-peer network"" - assigns URLs
 to Word files... and somebody /bought/ that?

 ""The XDegrees System allows users to easily and consistently locate, access
 and manage information by assigning each document a unique link. Providing
 end-to-end security, the XDegrees System unifies authentication of all
 users, provides file-level access control and encrypts all stored and
 transferred files. Seamless integration with existing applications such as
 email clients and Microsoft Office products allows companies to rapidly
 deploy the XDegrees System and users to get up-and-running quickly.""
 
 Whoa... high tech...

 ""The essence of XDegrees consists of a naming system and a distributed
 database that allows peers to resolve resource names. XDegrees manages these
 services for customers on its own hosts, and sells its software to
 enterprises so they can define and run their own namespaces on in-house
 servers. You can search for a particular person (whatever device the person
 is currently using), for a particular device, for a file, or even for a web
 service. The software that resolves resource names is called XRNS (the
 eXtensible Resource Name System).""

 So far, but it's not even noon yet. Stealth patents are definately gaining
 in popularity, maybe we can get this included in the new death penalty for

 <font size=3><b>Techs rise, but Dow falls on day of Bush speech</b></font><br>
 Technology shares climbed Monday as Pres. Bush gave a speech outlining a plan for long-term growth.
 <p>
 Tech investors also heard positive comments on Intel by C.S. First Boston, and snapped up shares in the chip, storage and computer server hardware sectors. CNET's Tech index rose 15.22 points, or 1.53 percent, to 1,005.33, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 9.04 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,382.54.
 <p>
 Amid news of a weakening dollar and an unexpected rise in business inventories in May, broader markets sank. Recovering some from early-day losses, the Dow Jones industrials finished by giving up 45.4 points, or 0.52 percent, to 8,639.1, and the S&P 500 slid 3.47 points, or 0.38 percent, to 917.92.

 IBM announced a new top-end ""Shark"" storage system Monday that could boost the company's prospects against entrenched competitors in the depressed storage market.

 Microsoft on Monday launched the first of several pre-emptive strikes against Apple Computer's Macworld trade show by making announcements about new technologies far ahead of their delivery to market.
 The strategic attack comes as tensions mount between Apple and Microsoft. During Macworld five years ago, the two companies announced a five-year technology agreement, whereby Microsoft committed to continued development of Office and Internet Explorer for the Mac.<br><B>MICROSOFT CORP 51.80 -0.12% </B>

 Analyst Tim Mahon predicts the chip titan will report second-quarter results in-line with expectations, but offer better-than-expected guidance for the third quarter. Intel rival AMD's poor quarterly results stemmed more from company-specific issues than PC market troubles, Mahon says. And he points to other evidence of PC strength, such as Dell's positive comments about the current quarter. Mahon also expects Intel to speak confidently about its new 845G chipset, which he suggests could pressure the shares of graphics chip firms. Mahon reiterates a ""buy"" rating on Intel.<br><B>INTEL CORP 19.12 6.28% </B><br>

 No. 1 data storage machine maker EMC Corp. on Monday said it named an outsider to its board of directors, bowing to pressure from shareholders who said the board had too many insiders.
 
 EMC said Gail Deegan, the former chief financial officer of Houghton Mifflin Co., will become the eighth member of its board, filling a seat left vacant since the fall. Deegan, 55, will also be a member of the audit committee.<br><B>EMC CORP 9.10 6.43% </B><br>

391,"Subject: UCI Creative Writing
","More articles that support my fantasy that Irvine is the
 center of the universe.  We've got the corner on electric
 cars, fuel cells, two types of Nobel winning physics,
 outside the box computer science, and lot of creative writers.
 
 UCI's creative writing department has been in the 
 news a lot over the course of the last decade.  Some
 quotes from the article[1]:
 
    ""In 1992, Newsweek called UCI's fiction writing workshop
     'the hottest writing program in the country.' Now it's
     exponentially hotter, thanks only in part to Sebold's daring
     and uncannily timely novel. 
 
 The novel they are talking about is Alice Sebold's ""The
 Lovely Bones"" which is on the way to the top of the 
 NY Times best-sellers list.  My uncle used to tease me
 about UCI (being a USC graduate from '54) that nobody
 knew who UC Irvine was just two states over.  In fact,
 I used to refer to UCI as one of the lesser known UC
 schools, and when I went off to college in 1985, my
 relatives told everyone I was off to Cal State Irvine. 
 I took a class as an undergrad by one of the department's 
 faculty called ""the art of writing fiction"".   If there
 was ever any two classes that helped contributed to writing
 my dissertation, it was that one which taught me how to
 get the writing flowing and my high school typing class
 which taught me how to type really fast.  
 
 One of the advantages they cite in the article is that they
 seem to take a chance on the ""not-so-sure"" bet, but according
 to the article, the number of UCI graduates that have gone on
 to write best sellers and the handful that feed the film industry
 is creating a viscious cycle that lures more talent which
 creates the right writing ecosystem, which churns out more
 success stories which lures more talent.

 Subject: Sun donates elliptic curve code to OpenSSL?
 
 
 According to this:
 
 http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2002-09/sunflash.20020919.8.html
 
 Sun is donating some elliptic curve code to the OpenSSL project. Does
 anyone know details that they would care to share on the nature of the
 donation?

 Yes, I am.  Everything is built inside a chroot.  I think it isn't linking 
 to a lib somewhere, I'm just not sure what lib it should preloading here.  
 Anyway to find out which one it is ?

 * Progress of Senate anti-spam bill

 IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHY YOU GOT THIS MESSAGE: Please see the
 ""About This Message"" section at the end.
 
 - --------------------------------------------------------------
 
 * Progress of Senate anti-spam bill
 
 Over a year ago, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN
 SPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return
 address to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would
 place enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and
 state Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service
 Providers (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.
 It would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws.
 
 The Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and
 reported it out largely unchanged.  It's not now scheduled for further
 action in the Senate.
 
 CAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to
 more spam, not less.  When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law
 last year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10.
 
 Our April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems
 with S.630:
 
  http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtml
 
 We're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and
 hope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that
 the entire Internet community can support.

 * European Union bans spam
 
 GLOBAL INTERNET COMMUNITY APPLAUDS EUROPEAN ANTI-SPAM VOTE
 
 May 31, 2002 - The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail
 (CAUCE), EuroCAUCE, CAUCE India, CAUCE Canada and the Coalition Against
 Unsolicited Bulk E-Mail, Australia (CAUBE.au) today applauded the decision
 by the European Parliament to protect European Internet users from the
 practice of unsolicited e-mail advertisements. Yesterday's vote will turn
 Europe into a virtual ""spam-free zone"" after the formal adoption of the
 directive, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or
 other similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not
 have a preexisting business relationship.
 
 ""This is a tremendous day for European Internet users,"" said EuroCAUCE
 Chairman George Mills. ""We are extremely pleased that the European
 Parliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added
 the right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the
 privacy of Europeans.""
 
 While six European Union member countries had already formalized ""opt-in""
 in their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all
 of Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003.
 
 ""Unfortunately, the rest of the world's Internet-using countries,
 including the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection
 of Internet users,"" said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. ""This is
 a tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow
 Europe's lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and
 network owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail
 advertising.""
 
 ""This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the
 European Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the
 European Parliament listening to their constituents,"" said Mills. ""Our
 members and our volunteers performed an integral part of this process,
 translating, lobbying and educating their representatives.""
 
 More information on the E.U. directive is available on the European
 Parliament's Web site <http://www.europarl.eu.int/press/index_en.htm>,
 and a EuroCAUCE analysis is available at
 <http://www.euro.cauce.org/en/amendments1a.html>. More information on

 I found stuff I thought would later get popular so I would not have to maintain the

 So if anyone is psyched, go for it. If so, let me know so I can get the RPMs from

 Folks, 
 
 Some of you seem to have hardcoded honor as the default catalogue
 server. There are three catalogue only servers running now, and honor is
 acting as a nomination only server. Tonight we will be completely
 turning off catalogue support on honor, so if you are specifying honor
 with the -rs option, please take it out and let the agents discover a
 closeby catalogue server.
 
 cheers,
 vipul.

 Craig,
 
     I don't really understand how you can make the claims that you
     make without a full understanding of TeS, which you can't have
     because we haven't published the details.
 
     In the end, given that you don't know much about TeS or how it
     works, your statements really call into question your intentions
     given that you have a competing product in this space.

  Most likely. But, seeing as I've flashed the thing with the most
 up-to-date BIOS I could get (with all the screaming 'experimental' stuff
 you usually see), and no luck.
 
  Next trick is to format /boot as ext2, and try again.

 SmartCards do not have fixed clock rates (more often than not) as the ISO spec 
 dictates that they are externally powered and clocked, but SmartCards used 
 for security purposes (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors 
 that make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES 
 faster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed.
 
 That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael 
 pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and 
 attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again 
 what we've seen is that it's not a question of ""is it secure"", it's a 
 question of ""who is it secure from and for how long?"" Security is rarely a 
 question of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather 
 it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are 
 designed to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the 
 $1-20 range (depending on the application).
 
 As whether or not they are ""trusted hardware"", the question again revolves 
 around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student 
 to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, 
 say, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad 
 EEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is 
 likely ""trustworthy"" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect 
 ICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, 
 a risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question.

 They removed /their/ Java VM. They didn't remove the ability to run Java
 programs.
 Anybody is free to develop their own Java VM and make it kick ass. As
 someone said earlier in the thread, nobody is capable or willing to do that.
 
 I've done a bunch of Java and haven't run into huge problems running the
 same bytecode across Solaris or Win2K.
 What actual problems have people actually run into. Actually.

 Tourism is the world's largest industry. Using this
 to preview your travels, or figure out where you are,
 would be very valuable.
 
 Online gaming continues to grow. Screw ""Britannia"", 
 real-life Britain would be a fun world to wander/
 conquer/explore virtually, in role-playing or real-
 time-strategy games.
 
 And of course, as James Rogers points out, it's an
 ideal display substrate for all sorts of other 
 overlaid data. Maps are great, photrealistic 3-D
 maps of everywhere which can have many other static 
 and dynamic datasets overlaid are spectacular. 
 
 (Combining those last two thoughts: consider the
 static world map, in faded colors, with patches
 here-and-there covered by live webcams, stitched
 over the static info in bright colors... it'd be
 like the ""fog of war"" view in games like Warcraft,
 over the real world.)

 Gateway's most basic desktop line offers some good values for
 students and families buying second computers for their children--
 if you configure carefully. But if you're eyeing the fancy LCD and

425,"Subject: What Warren Buffett won't tell ya ...
","It was the Spring of 1979.  
 
 I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
 with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
 cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...
 
 Stealing other kids' lunch money.
 
 No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
 them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
 ""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
 was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
 lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
 when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
 I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
 if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
 longer.
 
 Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
 started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
 and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
 things on their mind than last year's lunch money.
 
 I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
 and I didn't even get beat up.
 
 Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
 secrets you will ever learn.
 
 First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
 going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
 you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
 grabbing the lifejacket.
 
 Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
 They are looking out for their own money, not yours.
 
 The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
 money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
 buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
 your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
 Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
 ""NEVER"".  
 
 In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
 fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
 in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:
 
 Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?
 
 Hell no!
 
 You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
 make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
 in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
 the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
 you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  
 
 The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.
 
 If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
 is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
 those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
 by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
 care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
 it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
 money.
 
 What I'm talking about here is day trading.  
 
 My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
 and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
 he makes money. 
 
 The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
 $25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
 advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
 certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
 down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  
 
 I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
 amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
 only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.
 
 Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
 complicated and requires formal training.  
 
 The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
 strategies to make money.  
 
 Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
 trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
 ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
 don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
 to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
 dollars.
 
 They make their money only if you believe two lies:
 
 1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
 person.
 
 2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
 commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
 per trade.
 
 Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
 positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...
 
 The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
 so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
 a few hours of studying.  
 
 After reading over 200 financial books and publications
 during the past decade, and after using day trading
 to successfully make more than four million dollars in
 the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:
 
 ** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.
 
 ** Anyone can do it.
 
 ** It only takes a few hours to learn.
 
 When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
 wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
 Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
 only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
 hard work, knowledge, and determination.
 
 After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
 practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
 brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
 experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
 close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
 formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
 I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
 during those formative trading years I am willing to share
 with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
 my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
 secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
 year after year.
 
 The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
 hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
 minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
 shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
 and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 
 
 Average Income of a Day Trader: 
 5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
 22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
 35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
 27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
 11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 
 
 After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
 profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
 you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
 win DESPITE the current market weakness. 
 
 Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:
 
 *** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.
 
 
 *** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.
 
 
 *** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
 buy them and the exact price to sell them. 
 
 
 *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
 mistakes beginners make.
 
 
 *** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
 consistently in every market! 
 
 
 *** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
 for great success. 
 
 
 *** Profit on huge intraday price swings.
 
 
 *** Make money on the biggest news stories.
 
 
 *** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
 returns. 
 
 
 *** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
 professionals use.
 
 
 *** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 
 
 
 It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
 Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
 I going to take control of my own financial future, and
 start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""
 
 Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
 wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?
 
 With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
 need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
 choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
 lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
 trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
 dollars.
 
 The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
 understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
 trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
 trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
 own financial future.
 
 Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
 His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
 make money in the stock market.  
 
 Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
 coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.
 
 In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
 is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
 for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
 that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
 your kind of game.
 
 But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
 in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
 order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
 to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
 millionaire through successful day trading.
 
 You don't need to know anything about the market, and
 anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
 game to win if you know how the pieces move.

","
 It seems that something changed during the last 3-4 weeks.
 
 1) In a folder, msgs 1-n is read, n=current, n upwards is unread.
 2) change to another folder
 3) change back to the original folder and you'll see msg n+1 being 
 highlighted as current for a split second, that it changes back to 
 n=current.
 
 Kind of annoying since it marks msg n+1 as read.

 Supply a mod to tokenizer.py and I'll test it (eventually <wink>).  Note
 that the tokenizer already *preserves* case in subject-line words, because
 experiment showed that this was better than folding case away in this
 specific context (but experiment also showed-- against my
 expectations --that preserving case everywhere didn't make a significant
 difference to either error rate -- the subject line is a special case for
 this).

 Scripting languages allow rapid development of game behavior without the 
 pitfalls that await the unwary C++ programmer. Using an existing scripting 
 language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically 
 gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. 
 Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is 
 powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code

  From fairest creatures we desire increase,
 That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
 But as the riper should by time decease,
 His tender heir might bear his memory:
 But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
 Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
 Making a famine where abundance lies,
 Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
 Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
 And only herald to the gaudy spring,
 Within thine own bud buriest thy content
 And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
       Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
       To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

 Shakespeare, William.  Sonnets.
 
 William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,
 dramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English
 writer of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in
 Stratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him
 until he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway.  He enjoyed
 quick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a
 member of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the
 King's Men).  He retired in 1610, having spent a successful
 career as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants
 alike.
 
 Shakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the
 writer's life, leading many over the years to attempt to
 fill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that
 only result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will
 probably never know).  Among the rumors and hypotheses
 offered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;
 illiterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet
 (in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to
 take credit to shield the real writer -- a person with
 political ties).
 
 Shakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind
 and heart of the playwright.  Published in 1609, the 154
 sonnets involve the author's relationship with various
 characters, including a striking young man, a mysterious
 woman, and a rival poet.  The identities of the characters
 have also been the subject of much speculation over the
 years, despite the fact that they may have been completely
 created in the mind of the bard.

 I'm not a banker, and I'm not a credit expert - but these people
 speak from personal and professional experience. Draw your own
 conclusions. Lockergnomie Sang Vo writes: ""Though you may have
 zero liability for a fraudulent transaction, the paperwork and red
 tape to work through if someone empties out all your funds can
 leave you hurting for a while. There are many credit cards that
 now offer zero liability for fraudulent transactions. So, contact
 your credit card provider / bank to see if you can have such a
 plan added to your card or if you can apply for one that does.""
 And Russ Coover continues: ""If you purchase something with a
 credit card, and you later decide to dispute the purchase (for a
 reason such as the product was faulty and the merchant refuses to
 replace it or, perhaps the product was never delivered), you can
 legally dispute the charge with your credit card company. However,
 if you use a debit card to make that purchase, you have no right
 to dispute the charge.""
 
 <p>
 
 Jeff Morgan has a different interpretation of the regulation in
 question (E): ""In 12 CFR II, Section 205.6, it's saying that if
 you give your financial institution timely notice of the theft of
 your card or PIN code (two business days), you are liable for no
 more than $50, otherwise you may be liable for up to $500."" And
 Tim Miller extends the translation: ""If someone puts a false
 charge on a credit card, the worse that will happen is your
 liability for $50, with the possibility that your next charge
 might not go through because the thief used all of your available
 balance.  If a false charge goes against your debit card and wipes
 out your bank balance, however, outstanding checks can bounce.
  Your bank may be able to get you all of your money back, but the
 payees of those bounced checks might sock you with $20-25
 insufficient fund fees - and they are under no obligation to waive
 those fees.  If you have  5 checks outstanding, you could be out
 over $100.""
 
 <p>
 
 Frank Reyes was apparently lucky: ""Someone recently obtained my
 debit card number through a local grocery store. I was told by the
 checker at the grocery store that the card readers would only
 accept Visa cards not ATM cards. I was very suspicious, and used
 my debit card instead. Apparently, the store's computer had been
 hacked, and my debit card number and name (among several
 others)were forwarded to an unscrupulous individual. I was
 reviewing my checking account online two days later, and noticed
 an unauthorized charge against my account ($60.00). I contacted
 the vendor that had charged my account and informed them of the
 fraudulent charge. The vendor stopped the shipment, provided the
 shipping address to my bank, and credited my account within 5 days
 after I informed them (The delay in the fund reversal was due to
 the 4th of July weekend). The only negative aspect is the fact
 that I had to request a new debit card, which has yet to arrive.""
 
 <p>
 
 Further thoughts from Lockergnomie James Simbro: ""I'm not totally
 sure on this, but I've been warned against using a debit card for
 online purchases.  Yes, you may not be liable for any of the
 false charges on a debit card (in the end), but in the meantime
 (during your dispute) the money will be withheld from your account
 and you will not have access to it. However with a credit card,
 you are not responsible for funds that are in dispute. The
 scenario I was given, was imagine if somebody falsely used your
 debit card and cleaned out your checking account?  The money is
 gone! False charges on a credit card are not ""real money"" until
 somebody has to pay them.  I would guess that each bank has
 different policies for debit card fraud. I might just have to call
 mine and see what I'd face."" In short, be careful - no matter what
 you use or where you choose to use your plastic.

 {Manage your collections} It seems like everyone collects

 collecting dust. It's much easier than collecting stamps. If you
 do collect stamps, though, this organizer will help you keep track
 of them all. Or you can use it to keep track of your Star Wars
 trading card collection, or your coin collection, or your [insert
 collection here] collection. It works for everything, get it? It's
 also great for managing your MP3 lists, including ID3 tag editing.
 &quot;CYG is founded on an object-oriented database approach, and
 carefully programmed with one goal in mind: universal usage.&quot;

 &quot;This site makes it easy to transfer files to your Web server.
 Mostly it is useful for sites like FlamingText.com and
 ImageBot.com to send generated images to another server (such as
 your Web or FTP server). This is particularly useful for WebTV
 users who can't save images on their own machine. Although we have
 no pre-set limits (okay, it's 2.4 GB), the transfers that you do
 through Transloader.com must be completed in five minutes. This
 server is capable of transferring over 1 Gig per minute; if you
 are talking to a slow server, your job may not complete in time.
 Other transloaders sometimes suffer from overloading (too many
 people using them), which is why I wrote this one. Hopefully, this
 will never happen to us, but in any case, check these others out,
 they have some nice services...&quot;

 <B>To Share or Not to Share</b>
     <br>Scribbled by Lee Smith
 <P>
 I think that online file sharing is dependent on the file that is
 being shared. If the song is a current release or recent, then I
 do not believe in it. I can't consider it stealing because you
 can't steal from someone who willingly puts the file up for
 downloading. Those who did put the file online most likely feel
 that it is also not stealing, since they purchased the CD.
 However, I do not agree with RIAA or recording companies who are
 attempting to make their CDs &quot;rip proof&quot; either. I do not feel
 they have the right to dictate what songs I can listen to or when
 or in what order. I like to rip specific songs from CDs then make
 my own CD, which either goes down to my entertainment system or to
 my truck. The master CD is saved and rarely played (&quot;why&quot; is
 explained later in this message). I prefer making my own CDs for
 my truck because if my truck were to be broken into and my CDs
 stolen, it would be much easier to replace a self-burned CD than a
 master. Sometimes, masters cannot be replaced without a large
 expense, if at all.
 <P>
 If the song is outdated, an oldie (so to speak), and is not
 available anywhere, then yes, I do believe in it. Or, if the song
 being sought is wanted to rejuvenate one's collection, then yes, I
 do believe in that, too. Case in point: as a kid, I collected a
 lot of 45s and record albums. I have more than 4,000 records in my
 collection. Many were played so much that they are not playable
 anymore and, even though I did take care of them, due to the cheap
 stereos and record players in the 60s, they are 'shot.' I want to
 relive some of my younger days through music, but attempting to
 convert those records (to digital) is next to impossible for me.
 So, in this instance, no, I do not think it is illegal to seek out
 digitalized copies of the old songs that I already have records of
 (albums and/or 45s). If, however, the song(s) that I am seeking
 are available on CD, then I will be very quick to purchase that CD
 from Tower Records, The Warehouse, or any other reputable dealer.
 <P>
 For those that are impossible to find &quot;digitals&quot; for, then, one
 day, perhaps I will reach a point with technology (and money)
 where I can transfer those platters to WAV and they will sound as
 good as when they were originally recorded. I have been lucky
 enough to find some on CD thanks to the Internet; I was quick to
 purchase the disc, usually from the original artists themselves.
 Some of the music that I have, sadly, will never be heard again. I
 blame RIAA and the recording industry for that, too. Neither seem
 to care about the &quot;lost&quot; songs when digitally remastered CDs are
 released.

 some truly amazing desktop images, icons, and even calendars.
 She's got a very unique and creative style that you may enjoy. Oh,

 now you know it's all good. The best part? All these images are

 Who can save you from making a small oversight with your digital
 video camera purchase? Lockergnomie Frank Kenna: &quot;I see that
 you're thinking of getting a DV camera. I got one about a month
 ago, and I made one mistake: I didn't get one with A/V INPUTS.
 Mine has A/V outputs, which are great for getting your digital
 stuff out onto VHS, etc. But without the inputs, there's no way to
 get VHS or old 8mm footage into the camera. With inputs, not only
 can you get your old 8mm &amp; VHS stuff onto DV tapes, but you can
 use the camera as a pass-through device and get the old stuff
 directly onto your computer for editing purposes. I wish someone
 had made clear the advantages and importance of inputs when I
 bought my DV camcorder. The reviews and magazines I read barely
 mentioned this feature - and nobody stressed its importance. But
 if you're going to be doing any editing, it is critical (if you
 want to work on any of your old stuff). Don't make the same
 mistake I did - make SURE you get this feature. It doesn't seem to
 impact the price of the cameras; some offer it and some don't.&quot;
 This advice came not a moment too soon for me. Thank you for
 helping us, Frank!

 Chemistry types have a method for
 dealing with this question without
 dragging in the calculus:
 
 Suppose an atmosphere to be mainly
 affected by gravity, resulting in
 the potential energy for a mass M
 to be linear in height h: Mgh.
 
 What relative concentrations will
 we have when two different packets
 of air are in equilibrium?
 
 If they are at the same height, we
 will have half the mass in one, and
 half the mass in the other, and the
 amount flowing from one to the other
 balances the amount flowing in the
 opposite direction.[0]
 
 If they are at differing heights,
 then a greater percentage of the
 higher air tends to descend than
 that percentage of the lower air
 which ascends.  In order for the
 two flows to balance, the higher
 packet must contain less air than
 the lower, and the mass balance
 of the flows corresponds thusly:
 
     high percentage of thin air
     ---------------------------
     low percentage of dense air
 
 Now, rates are exponential in
 energy differences[1], so that
 theoretically we should expect
 an exponential decay in height,
 to compensate.  How does it go
 in practice?
 
 -Dave
 
 [0] How well does it balance?
     Chemical equilibria seem 
     stable, as they deal with
     very large numbers over a
     very long time.  Economic
     equilibria are viewed from
     the mayfly standpoint of
     individual people, and so,
     at best, the shot noise is
     very visible.
 
 [1] That is to say, rates will
     be exponential in the free
     energy differences between
     endpoints and a transition
     state.  We can ignore that
     complication in this model.

439,"Subject: [Razor-users] Razor 2.14 - the day after
","I recently installed Razor v2.14 and started using it.  I am finding it
 necessary to whitelist a _lot_ of mailing lists.  Some, such as yahoogroups,
 I can't whitelist because the from: address is the person making the post,
 so I will have to whitelist on another field when I can modify my code to do
 so.  I wonder if someone is not being careful about their submissions, or if
 these are bad mailing lists that don't drop bad mail addresses that become
 trollboxes in time.
 
 Any employee who has left my company more than three years ago is eligible
 to become a trollbox.  I figure after three years of bounced mail, the list
 should have figured out they aren't here any more.

 razor-agents 2.14 needs all parts to be spam to make a positive decision
 (though this will change with the next release), so it couldn't have been
 a background. Could you send me the debug log?
 
 cheers,

 Okay....Catchup unseen is something that I don't use often, but i can 
 certainly reproduce this.  I'll dig into it.  It's probably simple.

 Pitch Dark Bar Opens for Blind Dates
 Thu Sep 5,10:09 AM ET
 
 BERLIN (Reuters) - Diners at Berlin's newest restaurant cannot see what they
 are eating and have to be guided to their table by blind waiters because the
 bar is pitch black.
 
 The restaurant, which opened Wednesday, aims to make guests concentrate on
 senses other than sight.
 
 Holding on to one another, the first visitors followed waiter Roland
 Zimmermann, 33, into the dining room. Although the PhD student has been
 blind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery
 and drinks.
 
 ""I'm putting your plate right in front of you,"" Zimmermann said. ""I can't
 find my mouth,"" one voice replied out of the dark. ""I wonder what this dish
 is -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?"" another invisible guest said.
 
 In the ""unsicht-Bar,"" which means invisible in German, diners cannot choose
 complete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like
 a fish, meat or vegetarian option.
 
 ""We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and
 smelling,"" said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind and
 sight-restricted people, which is running the bar.
 
 ""People are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking over
 and are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent,"" he
 added.
 
 Of the 30 staff, 22 are blind.
 
 An average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around to
 help, Scharnbach said.
 
 And at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers have
 actually been eating.

446,"Subject: [Spambayes] hammie.py vs. GBayes.py
","There seem to be two ""drivers"" for the classifier now: Neale Pickett's
 hammie.py, and the original GBayes.py.  According to the README.txt,
 GBayes.py hasn't been kept up to date.  Is there anything in there
 that isn't covered by hammie.py?  About the only useful feature of
 GBayes.py that hammie.py doesn't (yet) copy is -u, which calculates
 spamness for an entire mailbox.  This feature can easily be copied
 into hammie.py.  (GBayes.py also has a large collection of tokenizers;
 but timtoken.py rules, so I'm not sure how interesting that is now.)
 
 Therefore I propose to nuke GBayes.py, after adding a -u feature.
 
 Anyone against?  (I imagine that Skip or Barry might have a stake in
 GBayes.py; Tim seems to have moved all code he's working to other
 modules.)

","
 Don't know much about eRoom - but there is the magic phrase 'collaborate in
 real-time'... Groove really has people running scared. Wonder if any users
 actually /benefit/ from collaborating in real-time.
 
 
 ===
 http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/INW20021004S0001
 
 Content-management vendor Documentum said late Thursday it plans to acquire
 privately held e-Room Technologies in a deal worth about $100 million.
 
 Documentum will issue approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock
 and pay about $12.6 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of
 eRoom.
 
 Documentum makes a platform for enterprise-wide content management. ERoom
 makes tools for enterprise collaboration. Its customers include Airbus,
 Bausch & Lomb, Ford Motor Co., and Sony.
 
 Documentum announced plans this summer to deliver a new Collaboration
 Edition of its content-management suite. ERoom was already integrating its
 tools to the Documentum platform, making an acquisition an easy target,
 according to Documentum president and CEO Dave DeWalt.
 
 With the upcoming joint product, customers will be able to collaborate in
 real-time via virtual workspaces, sharing schedules, resources, and even
 jointly creating content.
 
 Content creation and management has always been a collaborative task, but
 workflow has usually been delivered via a Web browser interface or even
 simple e-mail -- and rarely in real-time.
 
 For now, Documentum will sell the eRoom platform and its own
 content-management system through combined sales channels. Further
 integration is planned down the line, the companies said.

 What is silly and antiquated depends a lot on which country you live in.
 
 I don't have statistics on the love half life, but it seems long-term 
 relationships use something else for glue.
 
 Clearly our non-silly non-antiquated ideas about relationships have
 resulted in mostly short-duration relationships and single-parented,
 dysfunctional kids (not enough of them too boot, so to keep our
 demographics from completely keeling over we're importing them from places
 with mostly silly and antiquated ideas).
 
 At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and
 counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we're doing
 something wrong.
 
 Maybe we should really go dirty Tleilaxu all the way.

 I have to agree here.  If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not
 support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is
 nobody's problem but Habeas's.
 
 A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of
 incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet
 to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...

 This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all
 its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject
 at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  
 If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,
 there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their
 thresholds to 5.

 Newsletters won't use the mark.  Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor
 of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message
 basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.

 Sorry, that just can't work.
 
 If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam,
 and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,
 SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then
 spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody
 left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their
 will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.
 
 Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to
 make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose
 for which it was designed.
 
 Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against
 real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,
 then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights
 to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both
 created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that
 everybody has to pay them for.
 
 The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do
 absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with
 lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly
 from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the
 privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll
 ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.
 
 [*] And I use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could 
 consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.

 I'm working with an experimental text recognition/processing engine that
 exhibits similar characteristics.  It can read right through
 misspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the author
 above suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.
 
 If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything
 like the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the
 first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is
 that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially
 more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be
 resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far
 less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.

 able to do a nmblookup without using the -B (broadcast address flag). Does
 anyone know how 
 samba can be configured to do broadcasts to subnets other than just the
 local subnet. 
 I don't think this has anything to do with the remote announce parameter.
 
 Thanks
 Bryan

 Slaughter in the Name of God
 By Salman Rushdie
 Friday, March 8, 2002; Page A33 Washington Post
 
 The defining image of the week, for me, is of a small child's burned and 
 blackened arm, its tiny fingers curled into a fist, protruding from the 
 remains of a human bonfire in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, in India. The murder 
 of children is something of an Indian specialty. The routine daily 
 killings of unwanted girl babies . . . the massacre of innocents in 
 Nellie, Assam, in the 1980s when village turned against neighboring 
 village . . . the massacre of Sikh children in Delhi during the 
 horrifying reprisal murders that followed Indira Gandhi's assassination: 
 They bear witness to our particular gift, always most dazzlingly in 
 evidence at times of religious unrest, for dousing our children in 
 kerosene and setting them alight, or cutting their throats, or 
 smothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length 
 of wood.
 
 I say ""our"" because I write as an Indian man, born and bred, who loves 
 India deeply and knows that what one of us does today, any of us is 
 potentially capable of doing tomorrow. If I take pride in India's 
 strengths, then India's sins must be mine as well. Do I sound angry? 
 Good. Ashamed and disgusted? I certainly hope so. Because, as India 
 undergoes its worst bout of Hindu-Muslim bloodletting in more than a 
 decade, many people have not been sounding anything like angry, ashamed 
 or disgusted enough. Police chiefs have been excusing their men's 
 unwillingness to defend the citizens of India, without regard to 
 religion, by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to 
 the same sentiments as the nation in general.
 
 Meanwhile, India's political masters have been tut-tutting and offering 
 the usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control. 
 (It has escaped nobody's notice that the ruling party, the Bharatiya 
 Janata Party (BJP), or Indian People's Party, and the Hindu extremists 
 of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or World Hindu Council, are sister 
 organizations and offshoots of the same parent body.) Even some 
 international commentators, such as Britain's Independent newspaper, 
 urge us to ""beware excess pessimism.""
 
 The horrible truth about communal slaughter in India is that we're used 
 to it. It happens every so often; then it dies down. That's how life is, 
 folks. Most of the time India is the world's largest secular democracy; 
 and if, once in a while, it lets off a little crazy religious steam, we 
 mustn't let that distort the picture.
 
 Of course, there are political explanations. Ever since December 1992, 
 when a VHP mob demolished a 400-year-old Muslim mosque in Ayodhya, which 
 they claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god Ram, Hindu 
 fanatics have been looking for this fight. The pity of it is that some 
 Muslims were ready to give it to them. Their murderous attack on the 
 train-load of VHP activists at Godhra (with its awful, atavistic echoes 
 of the killings of Hindus and Muslims by the train-load during the 
 partition riots of 1947) played right into the Hindu extremists' hands.
 
 The VHP has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and 
 insufficient radicalism of India's BJP government. Prime Minister Atal 
 Bihari Vajpayee is more moderate than his party; he also heads a 
 coalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the BJP's 
 more extreme Hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together. 
 But it isn't working anymore. In state elections across the country, the 
 BJP is being trounced. This may have been the last straw for the VHP 
 firebrands. Why put up with the government's betrayal of their fascistic 
 agenda when that betrayal doesn't even result in electoral success?
 
 The electoral failure of the BJP is thus, in all probability, the spark 
 that lit the fire. The VHP is determined to build a Hindu temple on the 
 site of the demolished Ayodhya mosque -- that's where the Godhra dead 
 were coming from -- and there are, reprehensibly, idiotically, 
 tragically, Muslims in India equally determined to resist them. Vajpayee 
 has insisted that the slow Indian courts must decide the rights and 
 wrongs of the Ayodhya issue. The VHP is no longer prepared to wait.
 
 The distinguished Indian writer Mahasveta Devi, in a letter to India's 
 president, K. R. Narayanan, blames the Gujarat government (led by a BJP 
 hard-liner) as well as the central government for doing ""too little too 
 late."" She pins the blame firmly on the ""motivated, well-planned out and 
 provocative actions"" of the Hindu nationalists. But another writer, the 
 Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul, speaking in India just a week before the 
 violence erupted, denounced India's Muslims en masse and praised the 
 nationalist movement.
 
 The murderers of Godhra must indeed be denounced, and Mahasveta Devi in 
 her letter demands ""stern legal action"" against them. But the VHP is 
 determined to destroy that secular democracy in which India takes such 
 public pride and which it does so little to protect; and by supporting 
 them, Naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces 
 the Nobel award.
 
 The political discourse matters, and explains a good deal. But there's 
 something beneath it, something we don't want to look in the face: 
 namely, that in India, as elsewhere in our darkening world, religion is 
 the poison in the blood. Where religion intervenes, mere innocence is no 
 excuse. Yet we go on skating around this issue, speaking of religion in 
 the fashionable language of ""respect."" What is there to respect in any 
 of this, or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around 
 the world in religion's dreaded name? How well, with what fatal results, 
 religion erects totems, and how willing we are to kill for them! And 
 when we've done it often enough, the deadening of affect that results 
 makes it easier to do it again.
 
 So India's problem turns out to be the world's problem. What happened in 
 India has happened in God's name. The problem's name is God.

 Wednesday's trip went fairly smooth overall, and I actually 
 enjoyed helping out my friend Larry with some server 
 software installation and network configuration tasks. His 
 kids seemed impressed with the new ability to copy files 
 between the five different computers and have Internet 
 access at any of them. Ahh, yes... geeks in the making.
 
 <p>After that project was finished, I met up with Jake at a 
 nearby Starbucks to shoot the breeze and catch up on all 
 things Lockergnome. We email all the time, but it's nice to 
 have a face-to-face conversation for a change. He had just 
 finished establishing new phone service with Verizon, so he 
 has a fun new PalmOS-based phone to play with.
 
 <p>After the dose of caffeine, I headed up to Boone, Iowa to 
 hook up with my cousin Casey and his wife of two months, 
 Stephanie. Their new house is awesome, but disappointing, as 
 there was no high-speed Internet connection or wireless 
 networking. We'll have to fix that. For now, I'll remain 
 impressed with the geothermal heating/cooling system and the 
 vast potential of the unfinished basement that will someday 
 make an incredible rec room [insert suitable Tim Allen grunt 
 here]. 
 
 <p>Casey is ticked about all of the rain recently because it 
 keeps eroding his dirt front yard into the drainage ditch. 
 The back yard is in great shape, as there was sod laid after 
 construction finished up, but he decided to save a few bucks 
 and seed the front himself next spring. This now assumes 
 that he'll have a front yard left by then.
 
 <p>The rain turned out to be the last event of the evening. 
 I drove through the beginning of the storms on the way from 
 Ankeny to Boone, and I just knew it was going to be a rough 
 drive home later since they were only getting started at 
 that time. I was correct. What would normally be an hour and 
 45 minute drive turned into nearly two and a half hours and 
 many, many animal sightings. As the night wore on, I was 
 half expecting to see someone building an ark in a 
 cornfield. Must have been where the animals were headed.
 
 <p>The rain guage at home showed 3.25"" this morning, adding 
 to the 1.25"" and 2.5"" amounts dumped out of it within the 
 last week. I considered setting the sprinkler up in the 
 front yard today as an attempt at neighborly humor, but 
 figured I'd just be labeled as a complete moron instead. 
 
 <p>So, what did I forget to take with me, you ask? 
 Directions to Larry's house. DOH! I had to dig out the 
 notebook at a close rest area in a vain attempt to quickly 
 memorize the route. Instead, I decided to transcribe the 
 list on my Jornada, which would be far easier (and safer) to 
 read as I navigated through the streets. There's still a use 
 for printers in this world, without question. Reading text 
 from the tiny screen bites. Larger print and bold text on a 
 sheet of paper is the way to go. At least I didn't leave my 
 PDA at home as well, which I actually considered doing.

 <p>Have you considered moving to a satellite Internet

 paints a rosy picture, there are a couple of things that you 
 really must consider before writing the check. The birds are 
 some 23,000 miles above the surface of the planet, so there 
 is a significant delay while the bits float up and back 
 down. The absolute minimum time for a packet to get from one 
 place to another is nearly a quarter of a second. Add in 
 hops across the Internet and other hardware latency and it's 
 common to see ping times of between 500 and 1000 
 milliseconds - an eternity when you're talking about TCP/IP 
 connections. Now consider how VPN connections are affected, 
 being that they are generally significantly slower on the 
 ground without the extra 46,000 miles. Ouch! This white 
 paper is a tad marketing driven, but I think their 
 explanation of technology and how they are addressing VPN-
 over-satellite connections is quite informative.

 <p>Even encryption software is potentially exposed to 
 security problems. Network Associates' PGP software, which 
 interfaces directly with Microsoft Outlook, has been found 
 to be vulnerable to malicious code within an email. Exposed 
 systems can be made to execute code of the attacker's 
 choice, and because email can be sent from anywhere and to 
 anywhere. Tracking down the source could be rather 
 difficult. Hotfixes for each of NAI's products are available 
 on their website.

 <p>You know what a database is, right? Sure you do. Can you 
 explain what a relational database is all about? Correctly? 
 There's a lot more to database management and development 
 than dumping a bunch of records into tables and generating 
 reports. Proper design is crucial. Trust me. I've been on 
 the receiving end of some lazy programming efforts that 
 ignore the foundation of relational databases, and it 
 usually results in additional work later.

 <b>Smile While You Surf</b>
 
 <p>I like creative use of 404 pages, so sue me. Some of you have complained about the one Chris created for display when you come across a bogus link on the Lockergnome web site, which I don't understand. Would you rather stare at that stupid-looking, uninformative and generally useless one that your browser provides by default? 
 
 <p>Cramsession.com posted some unique ""excuses"" for their site being down for maintenance, and I thought I'd share a few:
 
 <ul><li><p>Roses are red
 <br>Our web site is resting
 <br>We're fixing the server
 <br>While Everquesting
 
 <li>In the interest of research, we're testing to see how long it takes a Network Administrator to get through a people-size maze to the web servers. As soon as he finds them, we'll be back online... Unless the Marketing Minotaur gets him first.
 
 <li>Suicide note found on the web server: ""I've had it. I can't take the heat anymore. You ran me ragged, and what thanks did I get? None. Null. Nothing. I gave and I gave, and you still wanted more I spent every second of my day trying to make you happy, but it was never enough. Always work faster, do more, stay late, work overtime, be more efficient. I was never good enough for you anyway. You deserve better. Signed CPU."" 
 
 <li>You have reached the Cramsession Maintenance Page.
 While you are staring at this page, waiting for the website to come back up, (should take about an hour or two) We'd like to offer the following fun activities:
 
 <ol><li>Hold your breath until you see black spots dancing in front of your eyes.
 <br><li>Spin around in your chair until you get nauseous. Wheee!
 <br><li>Pretend your mouse is a microphone. Dictate a memo into it where you outline your plans for global domination.
 <li>Connect the dots!
 <br>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
 
 <li>Get monitor cleaner so you can wipe ink off of screen from connecting the dots.</ol> 
 
 
 <li>We apologise for the inconvenience of our missing web site. We're doing something really ""high tech"" and ""important"" behind this ""maintenance"" curtain. We'll be back just as soon as we catch all the gophers.....Again.
 
 <li>HELP! I'm locked in the Server Room. Please send Help! And I'm running out of potato chips, too!</ul>

 Can someone translate this for me? Lost all sense of Irish when moved
 over the border about 10 years ago. Not by choice mind you :-(

473,"Subject: alsa-driver.spec tweak for homemade kernels
","This is a multi-part message in MIME format.
 
 --Boundary_(ID_KtnWPrcWHTTzQa7OHxPjiA)
 Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed
 Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT
 
 I use a mostly Red Hat 8.0 system, but prefer to configure and build my 
 kernel by hand.  I'd like to humbly offer a tweak to alsa-driver.spec 
 that helps it build cleanly under such circumstances.  I recognize that 
 freshrpms.net packages are designed with standard Red Hat in mind, 
 including a standard kernel RPM.  However, I hope that Matthias will 
 consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation.
 
 The diff is attached below.  The first part of the diff contains a 
 conditional that checks to see if the expected RPM is installed.  If it 
 is, %{karch} is set as before and a new %{krpm} flag is set to 1.  If 
 the expected RPM is not installed, then %{karch} is instead set using 
 ""uname -p"", while %{krpm} is left undefined.
 
 The second part of the diff is simpler.  We only require that 
 kernel-source be installed if the kernel itself came from an RPM.  (If 
 the kernel was hand-built, the presumably the user knows enough to have 
 retained the sources in the expected place.)
 
 Again, I realize that I'm operating ""off warrantee"" by not using a Red 
 Hat kernel RPM.  Matthias, if you think this tweak is reasonable and not 
 too ugly, I'd love to see you pick it up.  If not, well at least this 
 message will sit in the archives and may help other folks in the future.

 Rael is plagued by MSIE instability on Mac OS X. I use a recent nightly build 
 of Chimera as my default browser. 0.4 has some issues with plugins (or with 
 QuickTime anyway) on 10.2, but the 0.5 builds are working great. Fast too! 
 Mozilla is ugly. MSIE is slow and unstable. Opera (on OS X) doesn't render too 
 many pages. OmniWeb and iCab are not keeping up. Chimera rocks. I have used 
 ChimeraKnight to do the updating. It also makes...

 As I understand it, there is a huge difference between native Americans
 who speak english at home and those who do not.  I don't have figures
 that separate those at hand, though.
 
 1989 American Indians (US Pop as a whole) -- Families below poverty
 27.2% (10%), Persons below poverty 31.2 (13.1), Speak a language other
 than English 23 (13.8) Married couple families 65.8 (79.5) Median family
 income $21,619 ($35,225) Per Capita $8,284 ($14,420).
 
 Note: High Income countries in 1989 were defined as having over $6,000
 per capita.  American Indians separated from the rest of the US society
 would still be considered a high-income society.

","http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1054
 
            Summary: Split up FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS
            Product: Spamassassin
            Version: unspecified
           Platform: Other
         OS/Version: other
             Status: NEW
           Severity: enhancement
           Priority: P2
          Component: Rules
         AssignedTo: spamassassin-devel@example.sourceforge.net
         ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com
 
 
 The current FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS triggers on any from where the user name ends
 in two or more digits.  I think this should be split up into different
 numbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can
 get different scores.  So I've made test rules that look from From
 names that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or
 more digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a
 single digit, just the sake of completeness.
 
 Here is what I got:
 
 OVERALL%   SPAM% NONSPAM%     S/O    RANK   SCORE  NAME
   15113     4797    10316    0.32    0.00    0.00  (all messages)
 100.000   31.741   68.259    0.32    0.00    0.00  (all messages as %)
   1.244    3.877    0.019    1.00    0.64    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS6
   0.576    1.459    0.165    0.90    0.43    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS5
   4.982   10.694    2.326    0.82    0.38    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS4
   3.434    6.337    2.084    0.75    0.35    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS3
   8.979   12.383    7.396    0.63    0.30    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS2
   8.847    6.817    9.791    0.41    0.22    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS1
 
 I should note that I get rather bad S/O's for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS, probably
 because so much of my corpus is made up of Yahoo! Groups traffic, which
 seems to have a lot of users that like sticking numbers at the ends of their
 names.  Here is the normal stats for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS:
 
   7.024   28.480    2.834    0.91    0.50    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS
 
 and my stats:
 
  19.228   34.793   11.991    0.74    0.35    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS

477,"Subject: URGENT ASSISTANCE(CONFIDENTIAL)
","Dear sir,,
 
 
 My name is DR Steven M Duba , the son of MR. Theo
 Duba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from South
 African Information exchange Johannesburg.
 .
 
 Due to the previous war against white farmers in
 Zimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters
 to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he
 ordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all
 their farms to his party members and his followers. My
 father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman
 behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our
 country,my fayher was totaly against the act by the
 presidnt MUGABE. The presidents supporters invaded my
 fathers farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrested
 him and confiscated all his investment.
 
 Early last year when this victimization of white
 farmers by president Mugabe started, my late father
 envisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost all
 his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of
 Zimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa.
 When he arrived South Africa, he lodged the box in a
 private security company through the help of his
 lawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real
 contents of the box to the security company, then,
 went back home. He registered the box as family
 treasure.
 
 While he was still in detention that led to his death
 due to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in South
 Africa because of the escalation of the crisis in
 Zimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. He
 was arrested on the 5th of March last year.
 Unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of
 December 2001.I came to south Africa March,2002.
 
 Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating and
 depressing because my fathers lawyer is presently
 hospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem;
 though the lodgment documents are with me, as such I
 want to relocate to your country for good. Presently,
 my residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylum
 permit as a refugee.
 
 I am seeking for your assistance in transferring the
 money in the security company (US$15 Million) out of
 this country to your country for investment. If you
 think you can help me, Please try to get in touch with
 me immediately with the  number below . Your
 compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated
 if you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in my
 country is still lingering, please endeavor to keep
 this information to yourself and secret, because I
 wouldnt want anything that will expose me, and the
 existence of this money.
 
 Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.
 
 Sincerely yours,
 
 STEVEN DUBA (DR).

 The Entire Tech Week in a Single Email<br>
 Saturday, July 13, 2002<p>
 <b>If you've ever taped a ""Seinfeld"" episode or traded music online, Uncle =
 Sam may want you--to stop.</b>
 
 <p>
 
 Draft legislation that is winding its way through Congress would sharply li=
 mit Americans' rights relating to copying music, taping TV shows and transf=
 erring files through the Internet. The first part of their proposal, which =
 would <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D8b-SBGBQY0y2oGDikAEY=
 IEElDh4B1FR"" >limit backup copies</a>, has drawn objections from academics =
 and nonprofit groups that have reviewed it.
 
 <p>
 
 Under current copyright law, Americans who record a TV program or radio seg=
 ment generally may ""sell or otherwise dispose of"" that analog recording or =
 digital file as they wish.
 
 <p>
 
 The proposed bill would end that exemption, handing copyright owners substa=
 ntial new control over the distribution of their works by curtailing a cons=
 umer's right to copy material under a doctrine known as ""fair use.""
 
 <p>
 
 Another salvo in the copyright battle was delivered when a federal judge sa=
 id that record labels and film studios could <a href=3D""http://clickthru.on=
 line.com/Click?q=3Da0-11h8QQBqNNjxwbcUByjw2PB1s79R"" >expand an ongoing copy=
 right lawsuit</a> to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popula=
 r Kazaa software.
 
 <p>
 
 The Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Associ=
 ation of America last October sued three prominent file-swapping companies =
 in Los Angeles federal court. The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Net=
 works, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally=
  created the Kazaa software.
 
 <p>
 
 However, in February, Kazaa BV sold the Kazaa file-swapping software to Sha=
 rman, a company later revealed to be based in Vanuatu, a small island in th=
 e South Pacific. The recording and movie industry trade groups asked permis=
 sion to add that company to the lawsuit in June. A judge ruled this week th=
 at Sharman could be added to the lawsuit.
 
 <p>
 
 <b><font color=3D""#CC0000"">Shoring up U.S. security </font></b><br>
 
 Computer security is becoming <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=
 q=3Db5-50FcQ7U79NyMUQi1PHq15ZNEEZuR"" >increasingly critical</a> to Presiden=
 t Bush's proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally pro=
 posed the department last month, he never mentioned the Internet or so-call=
 ed cybersecurity.
 
  <p>
 
 But as Capitol Hill scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting abou=
 t tech-savvy terrorists--and insisting any new agency must shield the Unite=
 d States from electronic attacks as well. House Republicans have asked comm=
 ittees for any suggested changes to the White House-backed bill by the end =
 of the week.
 
 <p>
 
 Included in the proposal are radical changes for the U.S. government's Inte=
 rnet defenses. The plan would stitch together nearly all computer protectio=
 n functions, from the Commerce Department's Critical Infrastructure Assuran=
 ce Office to the Computer Security Division of the National Institute of St=
 andards and Technology to the Federal Computer Incident Response Center.
 
 <p>
 
 Additionally, the proposed department is likely to get its own <a href=3D""h=
 ttp://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3Dca-iciuQUgF71gRVXMcl8jfOfRHHUsR"" >priv=
 acy czar</a>. A draft of the legislation seen by CNET News.com states that =
 the Secretary of Homeland Security must appoint a privacy officer to ensure=
  that new technologies ""sustain and do not erode"" privacy protections and t=
 o verify that the agency's massive databases operate within federal guideli=
 nes.
 
 <p>
 
 <b><font color=3D""#CC0000"">Who's running your computer? </font></b><br>
 
 
 
 Perhaps a more immediate security concern to individuals is what is going o=
 n now with their computers.
 
 <p>
 
 
 
 Apple Computer OS X users could let hackers <a href=3D""http://clickthru.onl=
 ine.com/Click?q=3Ddf-1kJhQLEFh2TGWRjfbQq-Kh1XhaZR"" >piggyback malicious cod=
 e</a> on downloads from the company's SoftwareUpdate service.  According to=
  the BugTraq mailing list, a hacker named Russell Harding has posted full i=
 nstructions for how to fool Apple's SoftwareUpdate feature to allow a hacke=
 r to install a backdoor on any Mac running OS X.
 
 <p>
 
 The exploit takes advantage of SoftwareUpdate, Apple's software updating me=
 chanism in OS X, which checks weekly for new updates from the company. Acco=
 rding to Harding, who claims to have discovered the exploit, the feature do=
 wnloads updates over the Web with no authentication and installs them on a =
 system. So far, there are no patches available for this problem.
 
 <p>
 
 Users of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Outlook and Outlook Express applica=
 tions <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3Df5-lTbRQgwxlE6ooZY6D=
 mLwgkaZmRuR"" >may be vulnerable</a> to a recently discovered software flaw =
 that could leave their system open to malicious code carried on Web pages o=
 r in e-mails. A security researcher and partner at risk-assessment company =
 PivX Solutions warned that HTML objects embedded in Web pages and e-mail co=
 uld carry code that allows an attacker to check out victims' cookie files, =
 read their documents and execute programs on their computer.
 
 <p>
 
 Still another problem is plaguing Outlook: A popular plug-in that lets user=
 s encrypt and digitally sign messages has <a href=3D""http://clickthru.onlin=
 e.com/Click?q=3D0a-ZnKCIrrs-4R73PWBwhq6GOxuYzsR"" >inadvertently weakened</a=
 > security and left the mail program open to attack. Security company eEye =
 Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associ=
 ates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerab=
 ility in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a vic=
 tim's computer.
 
 <p>
 
 <b><font color=3D""#CC0000"">Wi-Fi everywhere, but not everyone</font></b><br=
 >
 
 One of the first cameras that can shuttle photos and videos using the Wi-Fi=
  wireless networking technology has made its <a href=3D""http://clickthru.on=
 line.com/Click?q=3D1f-rvwqI58wtiBX5xU1xmYgHobjqmZR"" >debut</a>. IQinVision =
 plans to sell the camera to companies such as security firms that need to p=
 ut video cameras in places where wires can't go, or as a way to quickly ins=
 tall a temporary security system.
 
 <p>
 
 This product is among the first devices to combine digital videography and =
 wireless LANs (local area networks) that use the Wi-Fi, or 802.11b, standar=
 d. Expect more digital camera makers to follow suit. The number of digital =
 cameras has been on the rise, and it's only a matter of time before a camer=
 a maker wants to add a popular new technology like Wi-Fi.
 
 <p>
 
 Wi-Fi is also <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D34-pJpSIcd8l=
 d53rX23_tvVyn4IcgdR"" >invading handheld devices</a>. Wireless equipment mak=
 er Intersil is working with SyChip to incorporate 802.11b wireless networki=
 ng technology into a Secure Digital (SD) card for handheld devices. The car=
 d, which should be available to manufacturers for testing in the fourth qua=
 rter, lets handheld owners add and remove wireless networking capabilities =
 to handhelds that contain an SD slot from Palm, Hewlett-Packard and other c=
 ompanies.
 
 <p>
 
 Wireless SD cards would make it far easier for handheld manufacturers and o=
 wners to get these devices linked. Only a few handhelds include wireless ca=
 pabilities, and they are some of the most expensive on the market. With the=
  card, wireless access becomes an option for many.
 
 <p>
 
 Not everyone is pleased with the explosion in popularity of wireless networ=
 king. Broadband providers are <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=
 q=3D49-ZM4cIEpSm4ht0v3VX4RVXFO5JSrR"" >cracking down</a> on some customers, =
 threatening to cut service to those who set up the inexpensive wireless sys=
 tems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.
 
 <p>
 
 After being introduced just a couple of years ago, so-called Wi-Fi ""hot spo=
 ts"" that tap into cable or digital subscriber lines (DSL) are now in at lea=
 st 15 million homes and offices. The problem is that one paying subscriber =
 can set up a local network that allows several other people to access the N=
 et, for fun or for profit.
 
 
 
 <p>
 
 <b><font color=3D""#CC0000"">News.com special focus: China</font></b><br>
 
 
 
 As China's society changes and its education system matures, the country is=
  becoming a major consumer and producer of computer products. And as the gl=
 obal recession leaves few fertile opportunities elsewhere, China has emerge=
 d as a primary target for foreign business. A News.com three-part <a href=
 =3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D5e-ssGdIn0656nzdldhsnStcVTQzciR"" =
 >special report</a> examines the various reasons that this may eventually b=
 e known as China's high-tech century.

 The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing 
 
 ONCE UPON A TIME a Wolf resolved to disguise his 
 appearance in order to secure food 
 more easily. Encased in the skin of a sheep, he 
 pastured with the flock deceiving the shepherd 
 by his costume. In the evening he was shut up by 
 the shepherd in the fold; the gate was closed, 
 and the entrance made thoroughly secure. But the 
 shepherd, returning to the fold during the night 
 to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly 
 caught up the Wolf instead of a sheep, and 
 killed him instantly. 
 Harm seek. harm find.

 My tests train on about 7,000 msgs, and a binary pickle of the database is
 approaching 10 million bytes.  I haven't done anything to try to reduce its
 size, and know of some specific problem areas (for example, doing character
 5-grams of ""long words"" containing high-bit characters generates a lot of
 database entries, and I suspect they're approximately worthless).  OTOH,
 adding in more headers will increase the size.  So let's call it 10 meg

 I just use Mozilla, and don't have to think about ignoring toolbar ads

 businesses who're particularly ""clever"" about making me see them obviously 
 don't want me to see them after all (since I leave, and never come back).

 I notice Opera tends to ignore my advertisement preferences, so this is 
 the core reason why I don't use it. Mozilla does almost everything Opera 
 does, minus the obnoxious ad slime, so why use use Opera then?

 I'd recommend a good external DLT drive.
 You will probably need a SCSI card for that too.

","http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2002/09/26/bono
 act.DTL
 
 Opening arguments are set to begin early next month in Eldred vs. Ashcroft,
 a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that will decide the future of copyright
 law, including how and when artists and writers can build upon the work of
 others.
 
 ....
 
 To heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an Internet
 bookmobile is set to depart San Francisco next Monday on a trip that will
 bring it to the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.,
 before arguments wrap up. The van, which will be stopping at schools,
 libraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free
 high-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are
 already in the public domain.
 
 --------
 
 I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and
 saw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a
 small satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding
 machine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a
 copy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total
 fixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA
 had the equipment donated) is under $10k.
 
 One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if
 they wished, add these ""virtual holdings"" (public domain materials) to their
 existing library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should be
 compelling to small libraries in remote areas.

 My question for the trust system is this. I signed up for a free account
 
 on some website that gives me free access to a large compilation of
 data, 
 and in so doing have subscribed myself to their mailing list. The
 mailing 
 includes a list of new articles and books and so forth as well as a few 
 links to their book store.
 
 This is consistently flagged as spam, even though I *agreed* to see it, 
 and I *want* to see what new articles there are, since some of them
 might 
 be interesting. Thus, since it is certifiably *not* spam (it even 
 includes a link to terminate your account), I revoke it. Even so, the 
 next mail is still flagged as spam.
 
 Who is losing a trust rating here? If it is not unsolicited commercial
 e- mail, it should not be reported by Razor as spam -- correct?

 <br>100% that it's true.&nbsp; Don't just take my word for it.
 <p>In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
 <br>selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
 <br>emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
 <br>it is absolutely true.
 <p>It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.&nbsp; Really, they
 <br>can.&nbsp; But, it takes several very important components to
 <br>join the 5% who are successful on the web.
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those necessities is a website.
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, your website does one of two things...
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
 <p>For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
 <br>not produce results.
 <p>And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
 <br>Poor sales letters.
 <p>Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
 <br>If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
 <br>your sales letter...
 <p>1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
 <br>Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
 <br>sales letter to.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
 <br>next door neighbor or your cat.&nbsp; Write your sales letter
 <br>just like you are writing it to them personally.&nbsp; Why?
 <br>Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
 <br>seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
 <br>Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
 <br>to be read to an audience rather than one person.&nbsp; Keep your
 <br>sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
 <br>going to read them.
 <p>2) Use an illustration to get your point across.&nbsp; In my
 <br>sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
 <br>the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
 <br>constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
 <br>businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
 <br>making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
 <br>across Montana on a grizzly bear.&nbsp; Leads have read of how
 <br>getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
 <br>marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
 <br>a solid message.&nbsp; Tell stories that illustrate a point you
 <br>are trying to make.&nbsp; Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
 <br>account from the ""real world.""&nbsp; It effectively creates
 <br>interest and further establishes the point.
 <p>3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
 <br>line.&nbsp; Your first line of the sales letter should
 <br>immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
 <br>more.&nbsp; Go back to the beginning of this article.&nbsp; The first
 <br>words were, ""It's true.""&nbsp; I can guarantee you that either
 <br>consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
 <br>Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
 <br>about.&nbsp; Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
 <br>paragraphs into this article.&nbsp; Carefully craft your first
 <br>line.&nbsp; If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
 <br>you've got a winner.
 <p>4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
 <br>lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
 <br>bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
 <br>service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
 <br>Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
 <br>each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
 <p>5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.&nbsp; Shortly after
 <br>your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
 <br>list of benefits to absorb.&nbsp; Hit them with your best shot.
 <br>Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
 <br>important things the reader will discover.&nbsp; By offering a
 <br>killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
 <br>create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
 <br>copy.&nbsp; After all, if they are already interested after the
 <br>first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
 <br>finding out even more reasons why your product or service
 <br>will aid them.
 <p>6) Just let it all flow out.&nbsp; Write down everything that
 <br>enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
 <br>can edit it later.&nbsp; If you just sit and start writing
 <br>everything you know about your product or service and how it
 <br>will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
 <br>information floods your mind.&nbsp; Write it ALL down.&nbsp; Then read
 <br>through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
 <br>many of the points.&nbsp; Edit it after you have exhausted all
 <br>of your ideas.
 <p>7) Make your sales letter personal.&nbsp; Make sure that the
 <br>words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
 <br>Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
 <br>yourself.&nbsp; I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
 <br>but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
 <br>your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""&nbsp; Leads aren't
 <br>interested in you or your products, they are interested in
 <br>themselves and their wants and needs.&nbsp; When you are finished
 <br>with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
 <br>webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
 <br>what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
 <br>""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.&nbsp; It's a free service.&nbsp; Make sure it's
 <br>at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
 <p>8) Write like you speak.&nbsp; Forget all of those rules that
 <br>your grammar teacher taught you.&nbsp; Write your sales letters
 <br>in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
 <br>Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
 <br>Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
 <br>Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
 <br>American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
 <br>Hemingway.
 <p>9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
 <br>Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.&nbsp; Use short
 <br>paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
 <br>afraid to use short sentences.&nbsp; Like this one.
 <p>Or this.
 <p>See what I mean?&nbsp; Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
 <br>the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
 <br>force the reader to get distracted.
 <p>10)&nbsp; Stress the benefits, not the features.&nbsp; Again,
 <br>readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
 <br>for&nbsp; me?""&nbsp; What need is it going to meet? What want is it
 <br>going to fill?&nbsp; How is your product or service going to be
 <br>of value or benefit to the reader?&nbsp; Spell it out.&nbsp; Don't
 <br>focus on the features of your product or service , but
 <br>rather how those features will add value to the life of your
 <br>reader.
 <p>For example:&nbsp; If you are selling automobile tires, you may
 <br>very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
 <br>but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
 <br>do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
 <br>we are traveling.&nbsp; So, instead of focusing on your selection,
 <br>you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
 <br>because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
 <br>selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
 <br>the benefits, not the features.
 <p>11) Keep the reader interested.&nbsp; Some sales letters read
 <br>like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
 <br>perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
 <br>filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
 <br>understand.&nbsp; Unless you are writing to a very targeted
 <br>audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
 <br>might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
 <br>and information that are easy to understand and follow.
 <p>12) Target your sales letter.&nbsp; When you are finished with
 <br>your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
 <br>specific audience.&nbsp; For example: If you are selling a ""work
 <br>at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
 <br>words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
 <br>women who are homemakers.&nbsp; Then, rewrite the same sales
 <br>letter and target it to college students.&nbsp; Write another
 <br>letter targeting senior citizens.&nbsp; Still another could be
 <br>written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
 <br>during summer vacation.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless.
 <p>All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
 <br>your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
 <br>is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
 <br>5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
 <br>5 hours a week.""&nbsp; Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
 <br>all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
 <br>(you could easily target 100's of groups).
 <p>Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
 <br>mediums.&nbsp; You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
 <br>in a campus ezine.&nbsp; The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
 <br>advertised at a retirement community message board.
 <p>By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
 <br>open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
 <br>to.&nbsp; And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
 <br>match made for them.
 <p>13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.&nbsp; Use short sentences
 <br>and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
 <br>grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
 <br>thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
 <br>letters...
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is to use a pause like this.
 <p>Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
 <br>to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
 <br>if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
 <br>several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
 <br>line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
 <br>get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
 <br>HERE to continue.""
 <p>14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.&nbsp; When the
 <br>customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
 <br>of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
 <br>If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
 <br>that let the mouse get away.""&nbsp; Use words to create a picture
 <br>in the readers' mind.&nbsp; When you think of Superman, what
 <br>comes to mind?&nbsp; Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
 <br>than a speeding bullet.""&nbsp; ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
 <br>""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
 <br>word pictures stick in our minds?
 <p>15) Focus on one product or service.&nbsp; Don't try to sell
 <br>your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
 <br>confuses the reader.&nbsp; Keep your ad copy directed at one
 <br>specific product or service.&nbsp; Then, use other products and
 <br>services as back-end products.
 <p>16) Make it stand out.&nbsp; Don't kid yourself.&nbsp; There are
 <br>hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
 <br>same thing you are doing.&nbsp; How will you stand out among the
 <br>crowd?&nbsp; Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
 <br>breathe of originality.&nbsp; Your product or service is
 <br>different. It's not like all of the rest.&nbsp; It is unique.
 <br>Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
 <br>competition.&nbsp; It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
 <br>this anywhere else.""
 <p>17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
 <br>Delete.&nbsp; Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
 <br>something?&nbsp; Get real.&nbsp; Don't make outrageous claims that
 <br>are obviously not the truth.&nbsp; You'll ruin your reputation.
 <br>Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
 <br>reversed.&nbsp; Once you have been branded a liar, you will
 <br>NEVER be anything but a liar.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if you
 <br>launch the most respectable, honest business available
 <br>anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
 <br>remember the crazy stuff you've said before.&nbsp; Be believable.
 <br>Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
 <p>18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
 <br>rather be EXACT.&nbsp; Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
 <br>weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
 <br>information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
 <br>mind.&nbsp; ""What am I really getting here?&nbsp; Does he even know?""
 <br>When you use specific information, the reader begins to
 <br>think, ""This person must have counted.&nbsp; I know exactly what
 <br>I can expect.""&nbsp; ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
 <br>human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
 <br>Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
 <br>leave no impression whatsoever.""
 <p>19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
 <br>want to know about your product or service.&nbsp; Answer all of
 <br>their questions, anything they would want to consider before
 <br>making a purchase.&nbsp; Think about it from their point of view.
 <br>Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""&nbsp; Then, address that
 <br>in your sales letter.&nbsp; Remove anything that would keep the
 <br>reader from making the purchase.
 <p>20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.&nbsp; Share actual
 <br>excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
 <br>your product or service. Many websites have an entire
 <br>section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
 <br>compliments listed.&nbsp; Satisfied customers remove some of the
 <br>doubt in the mind of the reader.&nbsp; ""If these people have
 <br>found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
 <br>probably will too.""&nbsp; Especially effective are testimonials
 <br>from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
 <br>field.
 <p>21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
 <br>A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
 <br>ad copy.&nbsp; Use them frequently -but don't overuse.&nbsp; A well-
 <br>placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
 <br>them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
 <br>paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
 <br>your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.&nbsp; They are
 <br>that important.
 <p>22) Avoid asking stupid questions.&nbsp; ""Wouldn't you like to
 <br>make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
 <br>you like to be as successful as I am?""&nbsp; Avoid any question
 <br>that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
 <br>feel like they are inferior.
 <p>23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
 <br>If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
 <br>purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
 <br>to influence them to buy in the future.&nbsp; By offering a free
 <br>item, you can&nbsp; request their email address in order to
 <br>obtain the freebie.&nbsp; By doing this, you can now follow-up
 <br>with the customer for a potential future sale.
 <br>Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
 <br>your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
 <br>And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
 <br>product or service which impresses the customer, they
 <br>probably will be back as a customer soon.
 <p>24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.&nbsp; One of the things
 <br>that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
 <br>is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
 <br>I am offering.&nbsp; Ginsu made this one famous. They were
 <br>selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
 <br>was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
 <br>it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
 <br>bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
 <br>the credibility of your main offer.
 <p>25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
 <br>and ""But that's not all.""&nbsp; These phrases effectively lead
 <br>the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
 <br>when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
 <br>leads into bonus items.&nbsp; Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
 <br>value and benefits to the reader.
 <p>26) Always include a deadline.&nbsp; By including a deadline,
 <br>you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
 <br>""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
 <br>bonuses.""&nbsp; ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
 <br>I've got to hurry.""&nbsp; Let the customer know what they will
 <br>be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
 <br>they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
 <br>miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
 <br>are very effective.&nbsp; Every sales letter should have one.
 <p>27) Tell them exactly how to order.&nbsp; Be clear as to the
 <br>order process. Point them towards the order link.&nbsp; Tell
 <br>them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
 <br>etc.)&nbsp; Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
 <br>If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
 <p>28)&nbsp; Explain when the product will be delivered.&nbsp; How
 <br>quickly will the order be processed?&nbsp; When will the order be
 <br>available?&nbsp; Let the customer know exactly what they can
 <br>expect when they place their order.&nbsp; The more specific you
 <br>can be here, the better.&nbsp; Let them know that you have a
 <br>system in place.&nbsp; ""Operators are standing by.""&nbsp; Their order
 <br>will be handled properly.&nbsp; Tell them.
 <p>29) Offer a money back guarantee.&nbsp; Take away their last
 <br>reason to hold back.&nbsp; Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
 <br>guarantee.&nbsp; Most people may not realize this, but in most
 <br>cases, it's the law of the land.&nbsp; You are REQUIRED to give
 <br>them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
 <br>product or service.&nbsp; Since it's the law anyway, why not make
 <br>it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
 <br>product or service RISK-FREE.
 <p>30) Instruct them to respond immediately.&nbsp; Many people
 <br>just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""&nbsp; ""Order today!""
 <br>""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""&nbsp; You've got them
 <br>this far, now tell them what you want them to do.&nbsp; Get them
 <br>to ""Act Fast!""&nbsp; Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
 <br>on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
 <br>way?
 <p>31) Include a post script.&nbsp; People will always read the
 <br>P.S.&nbsp; Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
 <br>parts of your sales letter. Why?&nbsp; Because in many cases the
 <br>visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
 <br>end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.&nbsp; A
 <br>P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
 <br>see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
 <br>description of what they will receive for their money. Use
 <br>your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
 <p>32) Include a second post script.&nbsp; You better believe
 <br>if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.&nbsp; Use
 <br>this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
 <br>another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
 <br>make them want to order.&nbsp; I guarantee you they will read it.
 <p>Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
 <br>a significant increase in the amount of responses you
 <br>receive from your sales letters.&nbsp; In fact, it would be
 <br>impossible for your responses to not improve.

 <p>Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.&nbsp; They'll
 <br>tell you it's true.&nbsp; Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
 <br>Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.&nbsp; They'll agree
 <br>100% that it's true.&nbsp; Don't just take my word for it.
 <p>In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
 <br>selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
 <br>emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
 <br>it is absolutely true.
 <p>It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.&nbsp; Really, they
 <br>can.&nbsp; But, it takes several very important components to
 <br>join the 5% who are successful on the web.
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those necessities is a website.
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, your website does one of two things...
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
 <p>For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
 <br>not produce results.
 <p>And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
 <br>Poor sales letters.
 <p>Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
 <br>If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
 <br>your sales letter...
 <p>1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
 <br>Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
 <br>sales letter to.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
 <br>next door neighbor or your cat.&nbsp; Write your sales letter
 <br>just like you are writing it to them personally.&nbsp; Why?
 <br>Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
 <br>seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
 <br>Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
 <br>to be read to an audience rather than one person.&nbsp; Keep your
 <br>sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
 <br>going to read them.
 <p>2) Use an illustration to get your point across.&nbsp; In my
 <br>sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
 <br>the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
 <br>constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
 <br>businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
 <br>making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
 <br>across Montana on a grizzly bear.&nbsp; Leads have read of how
 <br>getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
 <br>marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
 <br>a solid message.&nbsp; Tell stories that illustrate a point you
 <br>are trying to make.&nbsp; Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
 <br>account from the ""real world.""&nbsp; It effectively creates
 <br>interest and further establishes the point.
 <p>3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
 <br>line.&nbsp; Your first line of the sales letter should
 <br>immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
 <br>more.&nbsp; Go back to the beginning of this article.&nbsp; The first
 <br>words were, ""It's true.""&nbsp; I can guarantee you that either
 <br>consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
 <br>Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
 <br>about.&nbsp; Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
 <br>paragraphs into this article.&nbsp; Carefully craft your first
 <br>line.&nbsp; If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
 <br>you've got a winner.
 <p>4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
 <br>lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
 <br>bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
 <br>service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
 <br>Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
 <br>each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
 <p>5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.&nbsp; Shortly after
 <br>your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
 <br>list of benefits to absorb.&nbsp; Hit them with your best shot.
 <br>Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
 <br>important things the reader will discover.&nbsp; By offering a
 <br>killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
 <br>create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
 <br>copy.&nbsp; After all, if they are already interested after the
 <br>first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
 <br>finding out even more reasons why your product or service
 <br>will aid them.
 <p>6) Just let it all flow out.&nbsp; Write down everything that
 <br>enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
 <br>can edit it later.&nbsp; If you just sit and start writing
 <br>everything you know about your product or service and how it
 <br>will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
 <br>information floods your mind.&nbsp; Write it ALL down.&nbsp; Then read
 <br>through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
 <br>many of the points.&nbsp; Edit it after you have exhausted all
 <br>of your ideas.
 <p>7) Make your sales letter personal.&nbsp; Make sure that the
 <br>words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
 <br>Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
 <br>yourself.&nbsp; I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
 <br>but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
 <br>your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""&nbsp; Leads aren't
 <br>interested in you or your products, they are interested in
 <br>themselves and their wants and needs.&nbsp; When you are finished
 <br>with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
 <br>webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
 <br>what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
 <br>""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.&nbsp; It's a free service.&nbsp; Make sure it's
 <br>at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
 <p>8) Write like you speak.&nbsp; Forget all of those rules that
 <br>your grammar teacher taught you.&nbsp; Write your sales letters
 <br>in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
 <br>Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
 <br>Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
 <br>Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
 <br>American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
 <br>Hemingway.
 <p>9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
 <br>Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.&nbsp; Use short
 <br>paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
 <br>afraid to use short sentences.&nbsp; Like this one.
 <p>Or this.
 <p>See what I mean?&nbsp; Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
 <br>the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
 <br>force the reader to get distracted.
 <p>10)&nbsp; Stress the benefits, not the features.&nbsp; Again,
 <br>readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
 <br>for&nbsp; me?""&nbsp; What need is it going to meet? What want is it
 <br>going to fill?&nbsp; How is your product or service going to be
 <br>of value or benefit to the reader?&nbsp; Spell it out.&nbsp; Don't
 <br>focus on the features of your product or service , but
 <br>rather how those features will add value to the life of your
 <br>reader.
 <p>For example:&nbsp; If you are selling automobile tires, you may
 <br>very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
 <br>but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
 <br>do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
 <br>we are traveling.&nbsp; So, instead of focusing on your selection,
 <br>you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
 <br>because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
 <br>selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
 <br>the benefits, not the features.
 <p>11) Keep the reader interested.&nbsp; Some sales letters read
 <br>like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
 <br>perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
 <br>filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
 <br>understand.&nbsp; Unless you are writing to a very targeted
 <br>audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
 <br>might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
 <br>and information that are easy to understand and follow.
 <p>12) Target your sales letter.&nbsp; When you are finished with
 <br>your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
 <br>specific audience.&nbsp; For example: If you are selling a ""work
 <br>at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
 <br>words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
 <br>women who are homemakers.&nbsp; Then, rewrite the same sales
 <br>letter and target it to college students.&nbsp; Write another
 <br>letter targeting senior citizens.&nbsp; Still another could be
 <br>written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
 <br>during summer vacation.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless.
 <p>All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
 <br>your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
 <br>is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
 <br>5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
 <br>5 hours a week.""&nbsp; Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
 <br>all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
 <br>(you could easily target 100's of groups).
 <p>Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
 <br>mediums.&nbsp; You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
 <br>in a campus ezine.&nbsp; The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
 <br>advertised at a retirement community message board.
 <p>By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
 <br>open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
 <br>to.&nbsp; And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
 <br>match made for them.
 <p>13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.&nbsp; Use short sentences
 <br>and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
 <br>grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
 <br>thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
 <br>letters...
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is to use a pause like this.
 <p>Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
 <br>to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
 <br>if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
 <br>several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
 <br>line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
 <br>get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
 <br>HERE to continue.""
 <p>14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.&nbsp; When the
 <br>customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
 <br>of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
 <br>If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
 <br>that let the mouse get away.""&nbsp; Use words to create a picture
 <br>in the readers' mind.&nbsp; When you think of Superman, what
 <br>comes to mind?&nbsp; Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
 <br>than a speeding bullet.""&nbsp; ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
 <br>""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
 <br>word pictures stick in our minds?
 <p>15) Focus on one product or service.&nbsp; Don't try to sell
 <br>your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
 <br>confuses the reader.&nbsp; Keep your ad copy directed at one
 <br>specific product or service.&nbsp; Then, use other products and
 <br>services as back-end products.
 <p>16) Make it stand out.&nbsp; Don't kid yourself.&nbsp; There are
 <br>hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
 <br>same thing you are doing.&nbsp; How will you stand out among the
 <br>crowd?&nbsp; Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
 <br>breathe of originality.&nbsp; Your product or service is
 <br>different. It's not like all of the rest.&nbsp; It is unique.
 <br>Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
 <br>competition.&nbsp; It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
 <br>this anywhere else.""
 <p>17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
 <br>Delete.&nbsp; Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
 <br>something?&nbsp; Get real.&nbsp; Don't make outrageous claims that
 <br>are obviously not the truth.&nbsp; You'll ruin your reputation.
 <br>Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
 <br>reversed.&nbsp; Once you have been branded a liar, you will
 <br>NEVER be anything but a liar.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if you
 <br>launch the most respectable, honest business available
 <br>anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
 <br>remember the crazy stuff you've said before.&nbsp; Be believable.
 <br>Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
 <p>18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
 <br>rather be EXACT.&nbsp; Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
 <br>weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
 <br>information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
 <br>mind.&nbsp; ""What am I really getting here?&nbsp; Does he even know?""
 <br>When you use specific information, the reader begins to
 <br>think, ""This person must have counted.&nbsp; I know exactly what
 <br>I can expect.""&nbsp; ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
 <br>human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
 <br>Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
 <br>leave no impression whatsoever.""
 <p>19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
 <br>want to know about your product or service.&nbsp; Answer all of
 <br>their questions, anything they would want to consider before
 <br>making a purchase.&nbsp; Think about it from their point of view.
 <br>Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""&nbsp; Then, address that
 <br>in your sales letter.&nbsp; Remove anything that would keep the
 <br>reader from making the purchase.
 <p>20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.&nbsp; Share actual
 <br>excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
 <br>your product or service. Many websites have an entire
 <br>section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
 <br>compliments listed.&nbsp; Satisfied customers remove some of the
 <br>doubt in the mind of the reader.&nbsp; ""If these people have
 <br>found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
 <br>probably will too.""&nbsp; Especially effective are testimonials
 <br>from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
 <br>field.
 <p>21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
 <br>A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
 <br>ad copy.&nbsp; Use them frequently -but don't overuse.&nbsp; A well-
 <br>placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
 <br>them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
 <br>paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
 <br>your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.&nbsp; They are
 <br>that important.
 <p>22) Avoid asking stupid questions.&nbsp; ""Wouldn't you like to
 <br>make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
 <br>you like to be as successful as I am?""&nbsp; Avoid any question
 <br>that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
 <br>feel like they are inferior.
 <p>23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
 <br>If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
 <br>purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
 <br>to influence them to buy in the future.&nbsp; By offering a free
 <br>item, you can&nbsp; request their email address in order to
 <br>obtain the freebie.&nbsp; By doing this, you can now follow-up
 <br>with the customer for a potential future sale.
 <br>Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
 <br>your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
 <br>And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
 <br>product or service which impresses the customer, they
 <br>probably will be back as a customer soon.
 <p>24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.&nbsp; One of the things
 <br>that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
 <br>is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
 <br>I am offering.&nbsp; Ginsu made this one famous. They were
 <br>selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
 <br>was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
 <br>it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
 <br>bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
 <br>the credibility of your main offer.
 <p>25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
 <br>and ""But that's not all.""&nbsp; These phrases effectively lead
 <br>the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
 <br>when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
 <br>leads into bonus items.&nbsp; Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
 <br>value and benefits to the reader.
 <p>26) Always include a deadline.&nbsp; By including a deadline,
 <br>you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
 <br>""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
 <br>bonuses.""&nbsp; ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
 <br>I've got to hurry.""&nbsp; Let the customer know what they will
 <br>be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
 <br>they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
 <br>miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
 <br>are very effective.&nbsp; Every sales letter should have one.
 <p>27) Tell them exactly how to order.&nbsp; Be clear as to the
 <br>order process. Point them towards the order link.&nbsp; Tell
 <br>them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
 <br>etc.)&nbsp; Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
 <br>If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
 <p>28)&nbsp; Explain when the product will be delivered.&nbsp; How
 <br>quickly will the order be processed?&nbsp; When will the order be
 <br>available?&nbsp; Let the customer know exactly what they can
 <br>expect when they place their order.&nbsp; The more specific you
 <br>can be here, the better.&nbsp; Let them know that you have a
 <br>system in place.&nbsp; ""Operators are standing by.""&nbsp; Their order
 <br>will be handled properly.&nbsp; Tell them.
 <p>29) Offer a money back guarantee.&nbsp; Take away their last
 <br>reason to hold back.&nbsp; Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
 <br>guarantee.&nbsp; Most people may not realize this, but in most
 <br>cases, it's the law of the land.&nbsp; You are REQUIRED to give
 <br>them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
 <br>product or service.&nbsp; Since it's the law anyway, why not make
 <br>it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
 <br>product or service RISK-FREE.
 <p>30) Instruct them to respond immediately.&nbsp; Many people
 <br>just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""&nbsp; ""Order today!""
 <br>""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""&nbsp; You've got them
 <br>this far, now tell them what you want them to do.&nbsp; Get them
 <br>to ""Act Fast!""&nbsp; Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
 <br>on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
 <br>way?
 <p>31) Include a post script.&nbsp; People will always read the
 <br>P.S.&nbsp; Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
 <br>parts of your sales letter. Why?&nbsp; Because in many cases the
 <br>visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
 <br>end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.&nbsp; A
 <br>P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
 <br>see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
 <br>description of what they will receive for their money. Use
 <br>your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
 <p>32) Include a second post script.&nbsp; You better believe
 <br>if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.&nbsp; Use
 <br>this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
 <br>another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
 <br>make them want to order.&nbsp; I guarantee you they will read it.
 <p>Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
 <br>a significant increase in the amount of responses you
 <br>receive from your sales letters.&nbsp; In fact, it would be
 <br>impossible for your responses to not improve.

 Hi People,
 I'm rejoining Fork after a long hiatus, and inspired by the kinds of =
 stuff Rohit and Adam used to post once upon a time... here's a little =
 something that's damn inspiring...
 
 Nalin
 
 http://www.howardsbook.com/ch01/01.html
 
 Chapter One
 One Finger for Onions=20
 On March 15, 1996, I made over a hundred million dollars. That was the =
 day my company, IDT, one of the world's largest Internet and alternative =
 telecommunications providers, went public. As IDT's founder, president, =
 and majority shareholder, I was instantly rich beyond my wildest dreams. =
 People ask me if this was the greatest moment in my business life. It =
 wasn't.
 
 Four months later, on July 18, 1996, we released a new technology, a =
 breakthrough that would eventually cut the cost of international calls =
 by a remarkable 95 percent. That day Sara Grosvenor, the =
 great-granddaughter of Alexander Graham Bell, joined us in New York to =
 use our new technology in order to place the first phone call ever over =
 the network to Susan Cheever, the great-granddaughter of Thomas Watson, =
 in London.
 
 Within twenty-four hours of Ms. Grosvenor saying ""Come here, Ms. Watson, =
 I need to see you"" over our system, CNN, CNBC, and newspapers had spread =
 word of the development to investors and potential users and partners =
 around the world. Combined with a more than fivefold increase in our =
 quarterly revenues for the second year in a row, IDT's stock price =
 started to move upward again. Many people who saw me glowing that =
 morning asked if this was the greatest moment of my business life. It =
 wasn't.
 
 The greatest moment actually occurred approximately twenty-seven years =
 earlier on the morning of July 23, 1970. That was the morning I pushed =
 my newly built hot dog stand past Joe and Vinny's butcher shop on =
 Eastchester Road in the Bronx. Only two months before, Joe had driven me =
 from my after-school job in the butcher shop by forcing me to eat five =
 pounds of rice pudding (a task that took me close to two hours) after =
 catching me sampling the pudding while I waited on a customer at the =
 deli counter.
 
 I couldn't resist stopping in front of the butcher shop on my way to the =
 spot I'd picked out three-quarters of a mile away to set up my stand. As =
 Joe, Vinny, and Joe's nephew, Patsy, came out to see the new stand, I =
 was gloating over the fact that I was now just as independent in =
 business as they were. Nobody could make me clean out the rotten chicken =
 tank anymore. Nobody could send me five miles away on the delivery bike =
 in the snow to deliver ribs to a rich finicky lady who would just send =
 them back to be trimmed, and never tipped more than a quarter. Nobody =
 could make me lay in the sawdust and dig ground-up bones, blood, and fat =
 out of the meat band saw. And, most importantly, nobody could do all =
 this while poking fun at what a jerk I was to get all the dirty jobs. I =
 was only fourteen years old, and the wheels would fall off my homemade =
 hot dog stand many times before that summer ended, but that day, in my =
 mind, I was as rich as a Rockefeller.

","
 
 Hi all,
 
 
 Is there any way that the mailing list can be 
 turned into newsgroup?
 
 Newsgroups are great for threading of discussions,
 working offline and I feel that they work
 much better for this sort of technical discussion
 than a mailing list.
 
 Any ideas?
 
 
 Paul...
 
 p.s. Hamster doesn't work, cos I get the list
 through Yahoo!

","Dear Candidate,
 
 We recently came across a posting of your resume on the Internet.   After our 
 research, we determined that it was not posted on over 45 other top job sites. 
 The impact to you is that over 83% of the employers and recruiters looking to 
 hire candidates with your skills are not reading your resume.  
 
 Is your resume taking the day off?  
 While most people post their resumes on the top three job sites, such as Monster, 
 HotJobs, and CareerBuilder, there are many other specialized job sites that employers 
 and recruiters use to find candidates.  
 
 When those specialized job sites are combined with the top three job sites, your 
 resume is read by nearly 100% of the employers and recruiters who are looking 
 to hire or place candidates with your skills.

 Right you are.  The SRPM includes a patch to enable it, but then the
 specfile defaults to not applying that patch.  I saw the former but
 missed the later.  Egad, what a convoluted maze.

 Bob,
 
 This capacitor drive idea isn't completely stupid, but neither is it well
 thought out.
 
 Maxwell (www.maxwell.com) makes and sells high energy density capacitors,
 called ultracapacitors.  They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage
 regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly
 the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16
 kilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic
 energy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in
 a vacuum.
 
 Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8
 kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much does
 the 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet
 it isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph --
 the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored
 electrically in the capacitor.  And it's not at all obvious that the torque
 vs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do
 it without wheels, drive train, etc.
 
 But if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag!
 
 On to the Lunarnationals?  Or would you prefer the bite of donut?

","I think one step towards deployment is creating a re-usable tokenizer
 for mail messages.  The current codebase doesn't expose an easy-to-use
 or easy-to-customize tokenizer.
 
 The timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical
 knowledge about how to parse mail messages, but the module wasn't
 designed for re-use.  I'd like to see a module that can take a single
 message or a collection of messages and tokenize each one.
 
 I'd like to see the tokenize by customizable, too.  Tim had to exclude
 some headers from his test data, because there were particular biases
 in the test data.  If other people have test data without those
 biases, they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include

     I was thinkinf about an addition of another file: apt-repositories. Stick it on apt.freshmeat.net (the center of the apt universe, IMHO) and every time a new repository is added, the RPM can be rebuilt.  Heck, if I could get out of my depression, I could make the whole submission process automated....even making the RPM...

","
 When I get a box I don't want any of that integrated chipset crap 
 whether its for winblows or linux. Its just like IBM (mwave dsp chip ?)
 (shared video/main memory ?)in the old days. I know you can flip a 
 mboard jumper switch to turn crap off and install your own cards 
 but why bother ?
 
 To clarify my point is this ....
 Dell makes excellent machines and I would recomend their machines and 
 their aftersales support over any other manufacturer that I can think of.
 However if you want that box for linux and you have a life and you dont
 want to spend a week of it fucking arround and googling to get that box
 working properly be damned sure you do your research before you buy it.
 And this especially applies to their budget machines.
 
 And this isn't taking a swing at you John but ...
 
 >>Just a bad thing for those that hope a distro will work out of
 >>the box.
 
 A lot of the time the reason that you encounter this is cause someone has 
 such a box and they say to you ""hey can you install that linux code that I
 got
 from the guy in the internet cafe"" :-) and you say sure and you go to their
 house 
 (without a net connection/56k modem). And the machine has got this crap
 windoze
 only hardware and eventually you shrug in frustration and they say 
 ""well I didn't expect much from something thats free anyhow""
 
 When Dell were squabbling with Windows and it looked as though there might
 be 
 a Dell/Redhat alliance my Inspiron 4000 was produced ... it worked a treat,
 now that dell doesn't give a shit about linux all their new cheap boxes are
 linux 
 incompatable in small ways.

  Buying any new machine is going to cause problems with a six month old
 set of drivers. Same happens in windows - you have to go get your drivers.
 
  Yes, dell use the most recent stuff they can, to save money. That's not a
 bad thing. Just a bad thing for those that hope a distro will work out of
 the box.

 It did for me, but I am not willing to say it is not a tcl/tk issue as
 other apps seemed to work OK for cut and paste and Tk does its
 clipboard stuff a bit differently than most toolkits. So I'm not
 about to place blame. Just reporting my experience.
 
 Also, I am not talking about installing Gnome2. Just updating the
 many, many pieces of gnome to the current rev level.

 onvinced they are made by aliens trying to communicate with us.
 
 Crop circle enthusiasts insist that some of the designs appear so quickly a=
 nd on such a vast scale that it is impossible for humans to have made them. =
 
 
 Witnesses even claim to have seen balls of light moving through the fields =
 on the nights that circles appear.
 
 Researchers have found connections between some patterns and symbols from a=
 ncient religions, mathematics and even music. 
 
 Crop circles were first spotted in Britain in the early 1970s and now appea=
 r throughout the world. The weird outlines are still most common in the sout=
 h of England.
 
 Theories about their cause include whirlwinds  known to circle experts as =
 plasma vortexes  earth energies from ley lines or even forces from the huma=
 n mind.
 
 In the past the circles have also been blamed on mating roe deer, hedgehogs=
 , helicopters and holes in the ozone layer.
 
 Raymond Cox, Chairman of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, said last nigh=
 t: ""It's a great unsolved mystery.
 
 ""We know not all crop circles are created by humans but we cannot say for s=
 ure what is making them.""

 I had Apache, mod_php and MySQL running on windows 95 once :)
 
 As far as I remember, the only problem was getting the MSI installer installed
 on win 95, but that was mentioned in the docs. w2k has that built in, so you
 won't have that problem. You should be able to find pre-built binaries for 
 win32.
 
 For perl try activestate.com, that's worked for me in the past.

 Every week, we publish the Interactive <br>
 TV Power Rankings. We rank the 10 companies<br>
 that are benefiting most from the deployment<br>
 of new TV technology. <br>
 <br>
 This week's highlights:<br>
 Will the FCC approve the Echostar-DIRECTV<br>
 merger?; why did Cox scale back its Video<br>
 on Demand plans?; why did Liberty Media buy<br>
 a cable company in the Netherlands?; and <br>
 who at NBC is smoking crack?<br>

 TiVo: Now or Never?

 http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=tpysjsn6.e9iqjsn6.wxb5wqn6&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tvpredictions.com%2Fpredictions.html
 Ready for this?<br>
 <br>
 The next five months could determine whether<br> 
 TiVo, the Personal Video Recorder service,<br>
 ultimately survives as a business.<br>
 <br>
 TiVo, which launched five years ago, has less <br>
 than 500,000 subscribers. The company's stock<br>
 dipped below three this week. And network execs<br>
 are openly questioning whether the digital recorder,<br>
 which permits skipping commercials with a few <br>
 clicks of the remote, will destroy their advertising<br>
 models. There even have been hints that the <br>
 networks could support a move by the cable <br>
 industry to offer a PVR that does not permit<br>
 commercial skipping. And that PVR would not <br>
 be a TiVo. <br>
 <br>
 To its credit, TiVo has been remarkably successful <br>
 at building brand loyalty and awareness. TiVo <br>
 reports that 97 percent of its subscribers have<br>
 recommended the service to a friend. And when<br>
 people talk about PVRs, they say TiVo. (Just <br>
 like the way people say ""Coke"" when they talk<br>
 about soft drinks. )<br>
 <br>
 But Wall Street, the media and the industry <br>
 are all growing impatient. TiVo needs to start<br>
 putting some big numbers on the board -- <br>
 and it needs to do it this holiday season. If <br>
 it doesn't, stock analysts who have supported TiVo <br>
 until now will run for the hills. That will push<br>
 the company's stock price down even further. And<br>
 if that happens, TiVo could have just two choices:<br>
 Sell the company under duress or wait until its <br>
 funding dries up. <br>
 <br>
 Consequently, I predict that TiVo will launch <br>
 an intensive marketing blitz over the next <br>
 five months, right through the holiday season.<br>
 The blitz will include a sharp increase in <br>
 retail distribution, TV advertising and PR <br>
 efforts. The company needs to show Wall <br>
 Street -- and the industry -- that it will be <br>
 the brand leader in the PVR category. And it<br>
 needs to show that it can generate<br>
 mass consumer demand. <br>
 <br>
 How does TiVo demonstrate that?<br>
 <br>
 Anything short of 750,000 subs at year's end<br>
 will have people questioning whether TiVo has<br>
 the right stuff. Cable execs, who are watching<br>
 TiVo closely, might decide that adding the <br>
 service is not such a great selling point <br>
 after all. And Echostar, which currently does<br>
 not have an agreement with TiVo, may decide<br>
 to stay with its unbranded PVR service after <br>
 its merger with DIRECTV is approved in D.C. <br>
 (TiVo currently has a partnership with DIRECTV,<br>
 but it's unclear what will happen to the deal if <br>
 the merger is approved.) <br>
 <br>
 So there is much at stake -- and it's not extreme<br>
 to say that TiVo's ultimate future could be decided<br>
 in the next several months. <br>
 <br>
 Will it succeed? I predict that TiVo will achieve<br>
 a partial success. The company will boost its <br>
 subscriber numbers and it will maintain its claim<br>
 as the #1 PVR service. However, in time, I <br>
 also predict it will decide to sell the company<br>
 to a large media outfit, such as Sony or perhaps<br>
 even Liberty Media. This would give TiVo the <br>
 necessary funding and industry connections<br>
 for long-term growth and survival.<br>

 <br>
 The next five months could determine whether<br>=20
 TiVo, the Personal Video Recorder service,<br>
 ultimately survives as a business.<br>
 <br>
 TiVo, which launched five years ago, has less <br>
 than 500,000 subscribers. The company's stock<br>
 dipped below three this week. And network execs<br>
 are openly questioning whether the digital recorder,<br>
 which permits skipping commercials with a few <br>
 clicks of the remote, will destroy their advertising<br>
 models. There even have been hints that the <br>
 networks could support a move by the cable <br>
 industry to offer a PVR that does not permit<br>
 commercial skipping. And that PVR would not <br>
 be a TiVo. <br>
 <br>
 To its credit, TiVo has been remarkably successful <br>
 at building brand loyalty and awareness. TiVo <br>
 reports that 97 percent of its subscribers have<br>
 recommended the service to a friend. And when<br>
 people talk about PVRs, they say TiVo. (Just <br>
 like the way people say ""Coke"" when they talk<br>
 about soft drinks. )<br>
 <br>
 But Wall Street, the media and the industry <br>
 are all growing impatient. TiVo needs to start<br>
 putting some big numbers on the board -- <br>
 and it needs to do it this holiday season. If <br>
 it doesn't, stock analysts who have supported TiVo <br>
 until now will run for the hills. That will push<br>
 the company's stock price down even further. And<br>
 if that happens, TiVo could have just two choices:<br>
 Sell the company under duress or wait until its <br>
 funding dries up. <br>
 <br>
 Consequently, I predict that TiVo will launch <br>
 an intensive marketing blitz over the next <br>
 five months, right through the holiday season.<br>
 The blitz will include a sharp increase in <br>
 retail distribution, TV advertising and PR <br>
 efforts. The company needs to show Wall <br>
 Street -- and the industry -- that it will be <br>
 the brand leader in the PVR category. And it<br>
 needs to show that it can generate<br>
 mass consumer demand. <br>
 <br>
 How does TiVo demonstrate that?<br>
 <br>
 Anything short of 750,000 subs at year's end<br>
 will have people questioning whether TiVo has<br>
 the right stuff. Cable execs, who are watching<br>
 TiVo closely, might decide that adding the <br>
 service is not such a great selling point <br>
 after all. And Echostar, which currently does<br>
 not have an agreement with TiVo, may decide<br>
 to stay with its unbranded PVR service after <br>
 its merger with DIRECTV is approved in D.C. <br>
 (TiVo currently has a partnership with DIRECTV,<br>
 but it's unclear what will happen to the deal if <br>
 the merger is approved.) <br>
 <br>
 So there is much at stake -- and it's not extreme<br>
 to say that TiVo's ultimate future could be decided<br>
 in the next several months. <br>
 <br>
 Will it succeed? I predict that TiVo will achieve<br>
 a partial success. The company will boost its <br>
 subscriber numbers and it will maintain its claim<br>
 as the #1 PVR service. However, in time, I <br>
 also predict it will decide to sell the company<br>
 to a large media outfit, such as Sony or perhaps<br>
 even Liberty Media. This would give TiVo the <br>
 necessary funding and industry connections<br>
 for long-term growth and survival.<br>

 I'm facing another problem right now. It looks like libsigc++ is no longer
 included in the distribution, and gtkmm won't compile without it :-/
 I guess I'll have to repackage it myself for 8.0 (assuming it's possible).

 Dear Sir.
 
 First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. all though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start by introducing myself properly to you.
 
 I am the Manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance Department of Union Bank of NIgeria (U.B.N. Headquarters Lagos Nigeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland(UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7. 5 million(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.
 
 We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. 
 
 If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.
 
 Yours faithfully,
 
 DR MARKUS PHILLIPS.

 IMO spamtrap data that's well-cleaned and monitored is fine.
 
 To my mind there's 3 types of spamtraps:
 
   1. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps when the user closes
     the account
 
   2. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps several months after the
     user closes the account, scanned for newsletters, unsubscribed
     from them etc.
 
   3. real spamtrap addresses to trap website crawlers.
 
 The latter 2 are the most effective, but #1 is a real PITA; it takes lots
 of maintainance to avoid ham getting in there.  Some of my spamtrap data
 had a few 1's contributed by ISPs, and I hadn't spent enough time sifting
 for legit mail that was slipping through.  So I felt better leaving
 them out for this run, apart from what I'd hand-cleaned.

 A pastor walked into a neighborhood pub.  The place was hopping
 with music and dancing but every once in a while the lights would
 turn off.  Each time after the lights would go out the place would
 erupt into cheers.
 
 However, when the revelers saw the town pastor, the room went dead
 silent.  He walked up to the bartender and asked, ""May I please
 use the restroom?""
 
 The bartender replied, ""I really don't think you should.""
 
 ""Why not?"" the pastor asked.
 
 ""Well, there is a statue of a naked woman in there, and her most
 private part is covered only by a fig leaf.""
 
 ""Nonsense,"" said the pastor, ""I'll just look the other way.""
 
 So the bartender showed the clergyman the door at the top of the
 stairs, and he proceeded to the restroom.  After a few minutes, he
 came back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and
 dancing again.  However, they did stop just long enough to give
 the pastor a loud round of applause.  He went to the bartender and
 said, ""Sir, I don't understand.  Why did they applaud for me just
 because I went to the restroom?""
 
 ""Well, now they know you're one of us,"" said the bartender.  ""Would
 you like a drink?""
 
 ""But, I still don't understand,"" said the puzzled pastor.
 
 ""You see,"" laughed the bartender, ""every time the fig leaf is lifted
 on the statue, the lights go out in the whole place.  Now, how
 about that drink?""

565,"Subject: More fun with the PTC
","URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85378428
 Date: Not supplied
 
 I received some feedback in email (from several of you actually) regarding my 
 earlier blog about the Parents Television Council[1], which recently published 
 a report in which they labeled Buffy as the worst show on television for 
 children. Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.
 
 Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like 
 GTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply 
 warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is 
 a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of 
 primetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should 
 air during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to 
 restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The 
 shows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and 
 some aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents 
 and children wish to watch TV together during this hour.
 
 It should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television 
 viewing. If you don't want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then 
 don't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or 
 shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because 
 you don't like its content. If you don't think a show is appropriate, don't let 
 your kids watch it.
 
 The PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example 
 of one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show 
 inappropriate for kids. Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems 
 appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their 
 ultra-conservative agenda. Even then, I wouldn't really mind, but the idea that 
 all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous.

 That was my understanding too, but I since fould out that for Linux:
 
 Most programs and libraries by default are compiled with optimizing level 2
 (gcc options -g and -O2) and are compiled for a specific CPU. On Intel 
 platforms software is compiled for i386 processors by default. If you don't
 wish to run software on other machines other than your own, you might want to
 change the default compiler options so that they will be compiled with a 
 higher optimization level, and generate code for your specific architecture.
 
 Therefore:
 
     export CFLAGS=""-O3 -march=<architecture>"" &&
     CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS
 
 This is a minimal set of optimizations that ensures it works on almost all
 platforms. The option march will compile the binaries with specific
 instructions for that CPU you have specified. This means you can't copy this
 binary to a lower class CPU and execute it.
 
 So these are the optimizations I need to worry about, and the optimizations 
 that lfs says to disable before compiling GCC or GlibC. However, GlibC seems 
 the most likely candidate for optimization since it provides the libs used by 
 even the most simple programs to access system calls in the kernel.
 
 I'm still waiting for info from the GCC mailing list RE: optimising/patching 
 GCC for performance improvement. So far the only suggestion has been to try 
 using icc, Intels C compiler. It's known to work with the kernel, but user 
 apps, and I guess libs and such might need rewriting to compile, and I'm not 
 prepared to go to this length.
 
 For QT and KDE it seems there are also gains to be made with object 
 pre-linking, but there are also risks with this so I'll just have to suck it 
 and see. Either way, I'm going to get started building the base today. I'm 
 still waiting for some DRI patches for my GVX1 card but it'll probably been 
 several days before I'm ready to build X anyway.
 
 Cheers,
 
 	John Gay

569,"Subject: History of the tilde
","URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/04.html#history_of_the_tilde
 Date: 2002-10-04T00:27:41-05:00
 
 So I was researching the history of the tilde, because D told me that her 
 company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a 
 tilde in it. Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with 
 remarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that 
 reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be 
 honest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind 
 that. I don't want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the 
 tilde. 
 
 Every command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for &#8220;home 
 directory&#8221;, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username 
 will take you to someone else's, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to 
 their Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can 
 trace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal 
 pages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to 
 have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more 
 commonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html 
 subdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point 
 your browser to http://localhost/~username/, you're actually being served files 
 from that user's Sites directory within their home directory. 
 
 But I don't want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. 
 
 As with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in 
 this field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google (
 old habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene 
 Wallingford, which, like Jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a 
 tilde. 
 
 In fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be 
 used in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a 
 tilde in its URL. 
 
 Clearly, the tilde is underappreciated. 
 
 Digging further, we find this post of Jukka's from 1998[5], in which we learn 
 that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd 
 character called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if 
 indeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, 
 to be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. 
 The tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the &ntilde; 
 (now referenced in HTML as the named entity &ntilde;), but somewhere along 
 the line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky 
 uses. 
 
 Digging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for 
 #[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came 
 even later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^, 
 1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee 
 meeting, when it was proposed &#8220;as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease 
 SHARE&#8221;. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or 
 what this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn't until 1991, 
 when the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. 
 
 And now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of 
 yesterday called &#8220;Deja News&#8221;, and kids today call &#8220;Google 
 Groups&#8221;), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, _that_ William 
 Safire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially 
 pronounced &#8220;squiggle&#8221;. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary
 [10] to this very day. I'm not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was 
 cool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various 
 ASCII characters. 
 
 As early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem
 [11]. 
 
 In July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. 
 
 In February 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that 
 Fidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. 
 
 As early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. 
 
 As early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. 
 
 In November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements 
 (history,tilde,job control)[16]. 
 
 As early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed 
 in the APL-11 character set[18]. 
 
 In April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying 
 bugs in csh). 
 
 In December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced &#8220;tilde&#8221;[20], prompting 
 this typographical pun[21]. 
 
 And that's the earliest reference I can find. 
 
 So where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but 
 there are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the 
 tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for 
 &#8220;home directory&#8221;? When did it migrate into the world of web servers 
 to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web 
 sites? I don't know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing 
 my research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight. 
 May you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls.

","On The Way to Telluride, On My Way Back to the World
 
 8/29/02
 
 Dear friends,
 
 I go to turn my computer on but I have forgotten where the on/off switch
 is. I have had this laptop for three years, but I haven't turned it on for
 the past two months. I look on its left side, I feel around the back, I
 find it on the right and I feel like an idiot. The screen reads ""fatal
 error"" and offers to ""save"" whatever I had typed on it last June 21st, a
 few weeks before my mother died. I hit CTL.ALT.DEL. and it is gone. Gone.
 Gone like this long, sad, summer, frozen now, and nothing seemingly matters
 but everything matters more now than ever before. Why did she have to die?
 When will this pain stop? 
 
 I got up this morning to fly out to Colorado. The Telluride Film Festival
 is screening my film tomorrow night, the first time it will be shown in the
 United States. My mother did not get to see this new film. She was always
 so proud of everything I did, cheering me on every day from the day where
 my memory begins. I had shown an early cut of the film to my friends last
 winter in my parent's living room, and mom would come in and out of the
 room, catching a scene here and there, saying, ""Boy, that's something,
 isn't it!"" 
 
 I don't feel right, right now. I have avoided most people for the past two
 months. I can't conceive in my mind having to face a crowd of strangers, no
 matter how supportive or appreciative they may be. Everyone says to me it
 will be good to get back to work, good to be busy, take my mind off my
 sadness, as if not aware that what I really might need is for it to be the
 other way around. At my family's insistence, I tried going on TV a few
 weeks ago to talk about the corporate crooks roaming our great land. I had
 decided to give it a try, and gave it my best shot, and ended up feeling so
 empty and more alone. I had agreed to go on ""Crossfire"" and Donahue (thank
 God for this guy!) on the condition that I would not have to have one of
 those stupid cable news shouting matches with three rightwingnuts where no
 one can hear (or wants to hear) what's being said. 
 
 They agreed to the terms, but as Bob Novak asked his first question about
 aren't my true motives to destroy capitalism and make America a socialist
 country, I just sat there for a moment and didn't respond. I thought I
 would just take the microphone off and leave - who needs these f-----s! -
 but then, my dad was with me in the studio and I looked over at him and
 smiled, and then into the camera I said, yes, Bob, that is exactly what I
 intend to do and, considering more people have bought my book than any
 other nonfiction book in America this year, I guess that means that the
 majority of Americans agree with me on this point, so look out Bob 'cause
 we're going to seize your money first! I asked the studio audience in DC
 for a show of hands of all those who agreed and I was later told that
 numerous hands shot up in the air, much to the chagrin of a stunned Bob
 Novak. I also added that I thought the Pope was onto something when he said
 that capitalism is a ""sin.""
 
 My dad liked that. He is a sweet, strong, smart man and I loved the drive
 with him back home. We took a spin through the Michigan State campus and he
 told me how he had come down here after World War II to inquire about going
 to college but thought it best to return to the assembly line where he had
 a secure job. His years during the war serving in the Marines were going to
 be counted toward his seniority. And so he worked the spark plug and oil
 filter assembly line for 33 years and provided for mom and us kids and gave
 us all his love -- which, of course, mattered the most. 
 
                       *        *       *       *       *        *
 
 Dad took me to the airport this morning, remarking on the way how much mom
 would have enjoyed this simple trip across town to Bishop Airport, how
 happy she would have been knowing that I was heading off on a new journey
 in my very fortunate life. I thought about how she came to New York for the
 screening of ""Roger & Me"" at the New York Film Festival in 1989, and how I
 got to introduce her and my aunt as they sat in the front of the balcony,
 and how mom and Aunt Lois stood and took a long Lincoln Center bow, and how
 I stood on that stage and felt that she deserved every bit of that applause
 and more. 
 
 It's a bittersweet memory now, as I've just found out that the NYFF
 selection committee this year is too afraid to show my new film.
 ""Politics,"" is what I have been told. Too ""populist"" for the new elite who
 now sit in judgment of what is art. ""They don't want to help further your
 platform Mike,"" a person close to the committee tells me. ""One of them even
 said, 'I know this film is going to be popular - and I don't personally
 want to contribute to its popularity.'""  So, it was decided that ""Bowling
 for Columbine,"" a Cannes prize-winner, knighted by the Chicago Tribune as
 ""one of the most effective political/polemical films ever,"" a film chosen
 by every single film festival around the world this fall - no, this film
 must not be shown at Lincoln Center just six blocks from the edit room
 where we made it... 77 blocks north of ground zero. I've gone too far this
 time, cut too close to the bone, stuck my lens where it doesn't belong -
 right straight through the heart of an America that is both master and
 victim of the ultra-violence. It is so sad to see this place where I will
 always remember my mother taking that bow now cowering to the whims of neos
 who, like their counterparts in Hollywood, preside over the demolition of a
 once great art form.
 
                      *      *      *      *      *      *      *
 
 My dad drops me off and goes to park in the short-term lot. He comes inside
 just as the airport personnel are taking everything out of my suitcase for
 inspection. They don't ask to see the print of the film, the only thing I
 might have had on me that is poised to do any real damage (to all the right
 people, of course). My dad and I stop short of the metal detectors and the
 next round of inspectors who are anxious to look at my smelly feet. We hug,
 and he kisses me, and I am trying hard, so very hard, to not break down in
 the middle of this airport. He tells me not to worry about him, and I tell
 him I'll call him from Detroit when I am changing planes. I go through
 security and as I am being taken aside to be searched again, I look back
 and see him still standing there, watching out for me. My dad.
 
 I'm on the plane and I'm thirsty, but I took the water bottle out of my bag
 when I packed it this morning. The bottle, half-drank, had been sitting
 untouched in my untouched bag since I stuck it in there the night we had to
 rush my mom to the hospital. The bottle was still there in that overnight
 bag where I put my t-shirt and sweatpants, the ones I had on for the night
 and day I sat by my mother's side in the hospital as she struggled to live,
 holding her hand, holding her head, trying to comfort her, strands of hair
 on my sweater. I can see the stains from where my tears and mucus ran
 uncontrollably down my face and onto that sweater. The doctor said she had
 an 80% chance of making it. An hour before she died, another doctor said
 the chances were 1 in 100. That was good enough for me. One in one hundred!
 I've had those odds! I won! Don't let her die! Please do everything you can
 do! Don't let her die.
 
 The priest came, then another priest came, and when the priests left my dad
 asked us three kids and the three grandkids to all join hands and say our
 goodbyes to mom, say whatever we wanted to about what she meant to us. (I
 am sorry... I cannot complete this paragraph right now, I can't see the
 screen through the tears...maybe someday...)
 
 The night before we rushed her to the hospital I had a little surprise
 planned for her. I had brought a copy of my new movie and I was going to
 show it to her. As the end credits would roll, she would get to see what
 she has seen at the end of all of my work: her name along with my dad's in
 that list of credits...and, to me, it's the only real credit that ever
 mattered -- because without them I would not have the life they gave me,
 the way they raised me... it is all a privilege I will never cease being
 thankful for.
 
 I never got to show her the movie that night. ""Mike!"" she called out from
 the porch, in a pitch of voice I had never heard. ""Get your father! I don't
 feel good."" She was, without warning, dying. Within 48 hours she would be
 gone.
 
                  *          *          *          *          *          *
 
 I'm walking through the Detroit airport to gate 75 for the flight to
 Denver, and I hear someone say, ""OK, Mr. Stuckup, just walk right on by!"" I
 turn to see it is one of anchors from the local TV station in Flint. I
 apologize. My sunglasses are on. I have been crying since I left my dad at
 the Flint airport. I explain this to her and she starts to get tears in her
 eyes. ""My mom died in October,"" she says, and I realize that this pain that
 feels so solitary is, truthfully, a shared experience amongst us all. No
 one is immune from this loss. But instead of taking the time to tell me
 about how rough it has been for HER, she asks about how I am doing and how
 is my dad doing and did we get the flowers she and the others sent. She
 gives me her number and says to call anytime if I feel the need to talk. At
 that moment I remember what she told me -- that her mother also died this
 year-- and I think, man, get over yourself, Mike, you are not alone in
 this, and so I ask her how she is doing. ""I think a lot,"" she says, ""about
 all the things she won't see my two children grow up to do, to be. But I
 believe she is in my heart, right here, right now, and she will see it
 all.""
 
 They call my flight and I rush over to the payphone to call my dad to see
 if he got home OK. He tells me that when he left the short- term lot he got
 talking to the person in the tollbooth who told him about her mother
 getting cancer and how she was caring for her. ""She said that her bill in
 the hospital came to $60,000,"" he says with astonishment. ""They won't be
 able to pay it. She makes six dollars an hour, no health insurance. I gave
 her a tip along with the toll.""
 
 ""You gave the tollbooth worker a tip?""
 
 ""Well, you have to. That person could be you or me.""
 
 That is my father. That was my mother. 
 
 Yours, 
 
 Michael Moore

 PS. Thank you, all of you, who sent me your condolences and who contributed
 to the local poverty program in my mother's name. I was so moved by your
 generosity and by your words of love and kindness. It will never be
 forgotten.

 You could build your own apt-repository. Just mirror the needed directories
 (e.g. by using a wget cron job), symlink the needed rpms and recreate the
 repository. It is already worth the trouble, if you have more than one
 installation.
 
 In any case in order to acces the mentioned places, somebody must keep such a
 repository up to date, be it yourself or someone else.

 So some guy failed to reach the source, but instead got spin doctor to

","
     Damn, this thing is slick.  Someone seems to have done a very complete QA test on it; yesterday I installed it for the first time on an old Celeron box.  Sure, parts of it were slow, but compared to my more modern machine, everything is.  It was good; a beautiful interface that legions of 'sheep' can look at and say ""Cool; I can understand this"" and leave their shackles behind.  :)
 
     I was struck by the massive amount of applications, both KDE and Gnome, intuitively seperated NOT by the Gnome/KDE names, but by their **meanings** instead.  It's obvious that someone spent a lot of time improving the usability and graphics to make it more 'international'; the web browser graphic, for example, has a 'world' icon with a mouse wrapped around it. Office-apps have familiar pens, paper, and/or calculators involved.
 
     This is a Linux that I can plop down in front of almost anyone, and they can figure it out.
 
     At some point I'd miss the character of KDE/Gnome, and I'll probably 'hotrod' the graphics setup with my own themes, etc.  But for the wide release, this one's IT.  If you get a chance, try this; I think you'll be surprisingly pleased.

 More detail please?  I do use sequences, so I'm familiar with their
 use, but how can I make indices with them, and how can I keep them
 up to date?

 You're probably running exmh on a local machine.  I'm running it on
 a very remote machine.  In this scenario, the mime handling is weak.

","URL: http://www.newsisfree.com/click/-0,8613675,159/
 Date: 2002-10-06T18:12:45+01:00
 
 This feature, excerpted from Wolfgang Engel's ShaderX book from Wordware 
 Publishing, presents a simple shader trick that performs a good per pixel 
 approximation of a non-integer power function. The technique works for input 
 values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does 
 not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend 
 more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents.

 Polite and respectful protest is acceptable then. No dumping tea in the 
 harbour or anything like that.
 I think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on 
 television, and that the tactics can be
 justified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative 
 viewpoints from that medium. On the other hand,
 it was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault, and 
 the protestors were not in anybody's face
 (at least in my understanding of the vernacular).
 
 And no, being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence 
 politicians, but the standard way of using lobbyists and
 writing checks is beyond many of us.

 The GPL and similar licences are explicitly permanent grants of rights
 attached to an instance of his work.  (The other stuff mentioned
 concerns contract law, e.g., the required element of privity, etc.)

 No, the author has the right to issue _additional_ instances under a
 different licence, such as a proprietary (""closed"" [sic]) licence.  
 
 > Rick Moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting

 The analysis, here and elsewhere, concerns contract law.  This isn't
 contract law.
 
 This isn't the first time copyright attorneys have stumbled on this
 subject.  I'm sure it won't be the last.

 Also correct.  In fairness, though I cannot defend the Content-Length: header
 as I consider it brain damage in the extreme, Sun inherited this from AT&T.
 
 James> Get your mail administrator to add the ""E"" flag to your sendmail.
 James> This means you will never see a line beginning with ""From "". Any such

 Specifically, you will need to find a line in /etc/mail/sendmail.cf that
 starts with ""Mlocal"" such as:
 
 [4784] grep ^Mlocal /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
 Mlocal,         P=/usr/lib/mail.local, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@qPSXfmnz9E, S=EnvFromSMTP/HdrFromL, R=EnvToL/HdrToL,
 [4785] 
 
 and make sure that 'E' appears in the long list of flags following ""F="".
 If your sys-admin uses m4 to generate sendmail.cf, and any good sys-admin
 should, then here is the magic line for the .mc file:
 
 MODIFY_MAILER_FLAGS(`LOCAL', `+E')dnl

 Also correct, though procmail per se is not needed, as other filters (such
 as slocal, which is part of the [n]mh distribution) do the trick just as well.

 According to some old documentation (man exmh-ref)
 
      The mouse bindings for the folders labels are:
 
           Left - Change to folder.
           Middle - View nested folders.
           Right - Refile current messages to the folder.
           Shift-Right - Link current messages to the folder.
           Shift-Middle - Drag a folder label to some drop target.
           Control-Right - Clear the current target folder.
 
 It should be possible to link using shift-right-click the same way you 
 can move using only right-click.

 Check the procmail documentation.  They actually recommend:

 Yup, I've been meaning to cobble together procmail + script for this, as 
 a few Google searches didn't turn up anything. Did anyone here get there 
 first?
 
 (I guess I want a config file of mailboxes who normally sign their mail, 
 and procmail that runs gpg and adds headers...)

 FWIW, the 'Enigmail' add-on for Mozilla's mail client has it happily 
 talking to GPG (and I believe PGP). You can choose how long it remembers 
 your passphrase for, default is 15 mins.
 
 see http://enigmail.mozdev.org/
 
 This feature was enough to get my off my Pine habit, since (to answer 
 the original question) the combination of SpamAssassin and shared 
 whitelists means that forged 'From:' headers are pretty much the only 
 spam I see in my inbox now.

 There has been a significant recent increase in global CO2 concentrations.
 The vast preponderance of the new CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human
 activity starting around the industrialization of Europe, and accelerating
 after WWII. Most scientists studying global climate change believe that
 these increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for
 increased global warming. Hence our interest in items of human time scale.

 Most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the
 past have often been much warmer than today. The point of global warming
 isn't to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is to
 understand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on
 global human activity.

 The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity.
 
 It is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment
 subject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is the
 current best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2
 concentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth
 should be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may
 be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. I
 encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to
 eventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident
 as heat.

","http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,7493,781769,00.html
 
 Hamza's horrid - but we must tolerate him
 
 Rod Liddle
 Wednesday August 28, 2002
 The Guardian
 
 Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman
 to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing
 with his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.
 I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on
 statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the
 way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the
 sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,
 and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen
 for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and
 maybe me and you, too.
 But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the
 Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded
 happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic
 proto-warriors in the background.
 You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily
 Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye
 covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't
 mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom
 we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come
 off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the
 British right) as ""Captain Hook"", in articles which usually call for his
 arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe
 off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and
 thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if
 we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him
 to shut up.
 Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before
 September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all
 thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political
 persecution.
 And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've
 got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory
 manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of
 context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But
 perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and
 tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's
 scoop.
 Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier
 this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his
 allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were
 meant to do stuff like that.
 He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been
 frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the
 media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations
 and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly
 - repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be
 true - Hamza is not ""representative"" of British Muslims, as if British
 Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could
 turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.
 The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was
 revealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of those
 government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -
 dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism
 and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.
 An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an
 overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.
 One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US
 (the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought
 the war against terrorism was a war against Islam.
 Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the
 time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at
 home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from
 the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US
 foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action
 against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.
 Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't
 suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,
 the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful
 for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.
 Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has
 been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more
 inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His
 ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be
 happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for
 example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly
 repellent.
 And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire
 to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful
 appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the
 ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.
 Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that
 are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.
 The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing
 remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution
 is simply the pungency of his views.
 It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his
 rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This
 is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.
 You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And
 if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of
 unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is
 not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man
 up, therefore, won't make a difference.
 It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:
 The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.
 But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.

 Answering that requires fairly complete knowledge of the business
 model. But, in all probability: no, it isn't usually worth it. So, it
 comes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker's job.
 
 If the product requires occasional authentication, simple copying
 won't work; the product has to be cracked. In which case, the issue is
 whether you're actually going to enter into battle with the crackers,
 or just make sure that it isn't trivial.
 
 A lot of it comes down to your customer base. Teenage kids tend to be
 more concerned about cost and less concerned about viruses/trojans,
 and so more willing to use warez. Fortune-500 corporations are likely
 to view matters differently.
 
 > Does it really make it more secure ?
 
 Yes; software techniques will only get you so far. Actually, the same
 is ultimately true for hardware, but cracking hardware is likely to
 require resources other than just labour.
 
 Almost (?) anything can be reverse engineered. But it may be possible
 to ensure that doing so is uneconomical.
 
 > Look at the DVDs.
 
 IIRC, CSS was cracked by reverse-engineering a software player; and
 one where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that.

 Recently, MusicChoice upgraded their website with a very important 
 service, as far as I'm concerned: real-time song info from their 
 website. My DirecTV receiver is up on a shelf (and its display scrolls 
 intermittently); and I'm surely not going to fire up my projector while 
 listening to the ""radio"", so I'm quite happy that I can retrieve r/t 
 song info with URLs like:
 
 http://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/soundsoftheseasons.asp
 http://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/rap.asp
 http://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/opera.asp
 etc...
 
 Now, if I were a more eager hacker, I'd write up little WSDL stubs for 
 these event streams (they're clearly not worried about load, since their 
 own web pages specify 15 sec meta-refresh) and then feed 'em through a 
 content router to alert me to cool songs. Heck, cross-reference the 
 service to CDDB and... :-)

 You are wrong on both counts. Explanation is valid for symmetrical TCP, for
 others see explanations below.
 
 > Yes, all packets in an established TCP connection have the ACK flag set.
 > So all packets except SYNs are candidates for delay when traffic limits
 > are exceeded? Whoops.
 
 You should change that to: ... are always candidates for predictive or
 preventive delay.
 
 ACKs are delayed (per flow) in such a way that WAN-bound traffic reaching
 the edge router's Ethernet interface does not exceed WAN link speed (NO
 ROUTER QUEUES!). It does not wait for the link to be at or near saturation
 to act -- that is why, unlike queueing, it is predictive and not reactive.
 
 It slows down the rate of transmission of sending hosts (on a per-flow
 basis) to accommodate WAN link speed limit and current network utilization,
 rather than fill up queues at LAN speeds and empty them at WAN speeds,
 eventually dropping the excess once the queue(s) fill up, informing hosts to
 slow down their rate of transmission once queues are beyond a fixed
 threshold (90%?).
 
 Rate control works equally well for outbound and inbound traffic. Ever heard
 of an effective queueing technology for inbound traffic? Queueing packets
 after they have crossed a congested link does not make much sense, does it?
 
 Re: IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic
 
 It obviously cannot dissect IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic: it sees
 the tunnel as one connection if the tunneling device is before the PS on the
 LAN side (VPN gateway and router are two separate devices, PS between them).
 If the router does the tunneling, then the PS sees clear traffic. Typically,
 in an organization the first scenario would be the case at headquarters and
 the second at branch offices. The PS at the branch sees traffic inside the
 tunnel whereas the unit at HQ sees all traffic as one tunnel which allows
 full management of both tunneled and clear traffic at both ends.
 
 UDP and asymmetrical TCP (where the PS and router only see the outgoing
 packet, return traffic coming back through a satellite downlink to a station
 on the LAN) are handled differently.
 
 For asymmetrical TCP, it will time the release of packets to the receiving
 device, thereby indirectly timing the release of acknowledgements by the
 receiving host. This informs the sender's TCP/IP stack that it should slow
 the release of packets because limited bandwidth is available.
 
 For UDP, it utilizes flow-based derivative random drop. It selectively drops
 only one packet at a time from flows that are predicted to cause congestion,
 which prevents heavy retransmissions and application timeouts.
 
 ICMP packets exceeding policy limits are dropped.
 
 >_Maybe_ you can do a special case for TCP and try to offload some of the
 queueing on
 > the endpoints, but I really don't see the real gain in that.
 
 The real gain is manageability and control. A LAN host only knows about the
 state of its own connections and is oblivious to WAN conditions until its
 TCP/IP stack learns (when router queues are nearly full) that the WAN is
 congested. A PS will predict and inform the LAN hosts' TCP/IP stacks of the
 ""speed limit to obey"" for every connection (based on policies and network
 conditions), avoiding congestion. Control for asymmetrical TCP and UDP may
 not be as ""tight"" as for symmetrical TCP, but it does work.
 
 Queueing is akin to deploying cops only when traffic jams occur, vs. rate
 control where cops are permanently deployed throughout town, communicating
 with each other and with a central control point, predicting upcoming
 congestion and regulating traffic, ensuring a smooth flow of traffic. If
 there is potential for congestion, it will take a driver a hell of lot
 longer to cross town with first approach than it will with the second. Do
 you agree?

 Umm, don't get me wrong here, but I think you've been fed a less-than-
 accurate sales pitch.
 
 Let's ponder this for a minute.
 
 The device works by delaying ACKs... that is: packets with the ACK
 flag set, right?
 
 ...
 
 [letting this sink in for a while]
 
 ...
 
 Yes, all packets in an established TCP connection have the ACK flag set.
 So all packets except SYNs are candidates for delay when traffic limits
 are exceeded? Whoops.
 
 
 Okay, let's assume for a second that the packets aren't actually delayed,
 but that the ACK sequence numbers or TCP window size fields are re-written
 (dicey). All you've accomplished is move the queueing (delaying) from
 the traffic shaper to the endpoints. You still get L7-to-L7 delays. Big
 deal if it happens on the wire or in the stack. Also, convincing endpoints
 to do delays probably results in less-than-perfect shaping since stack
 retransmit timings suddenly affect the actual bandwidth available rather
 than having the shaper itself do it; the shaper knows exactly when there
 is bandwidth available.
 
 But this doesn't even begin to touch on other protocols like UDP or
 ICMP. Or, for that matter, IPsec/GRE/whatever tunneled traffic.
 Neither of them have sequence numbers or window sizes that you can
 manipulate.
 
 
 So, I'm forced to conclude that the PacketShaper either sucks in a major
 way, or that your explanation/the explanation that you have been given of
 it is wrong. (Sorry.)
 
 What I think happens is that the delay is <=2msec as long as traffic
 limits aren't exceeded. This is reasonable. BUT when traffic exceeds
 the limits, things will begin to be queued. Now, with a well-behaved
 TCP stack, this _will_ mean that it will fall back to lower transmission
 rates; this is how TCP was designed, so that part isn't all wrong.
 
 And, again, this kind of shaping isn't rocket science. That is not to
 say that there are shapers out there that are just being plain dumb
 (always queueing and the selecting what gets transmitted out of the
 queue), but, well, I just can't see that you can get any smarter
 than queueing when limits are actually exceeded.  _Maybe_ you can do
 a special case for TCP and try to offload some of the queueing on the
 endpoints, but I really don't see the real gain in that.
 
 
 Respectfully,

 Subject: DNAT with iptables question
 
 
 Howdy folks,
 
 I've been scouring the online docs for solid info on how to accomplish DNAT 
 with iptables.
 
 Essentially, I have converted the ipmasqadm lines of the form...
 
 ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L $WEB_OUT  http    -R $WEB_IN      http
 
 to iptables lines of the form...
 
 $IPTABLES -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp -d $WEB_OUT --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 
 $WEB_IN:80
 
 with the accompanying lines...
 
 
 $IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $INTIF -o $EXTIF -m state --state 
 ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
 $IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $EXTIF -o $INTIF -m state --state 
 ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
 $IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $EXTIF -o $INTIF -p tcp -j ACCEPT
 
 The last two lines seem functionally sorta redundant, but I threw em in in 
 an effort to make this work.
 So far, I am unable to show that it's working correctly... I even tried 
 logging all packets...
 
 $IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $INTIF -p tcp -j LOG --log-level info
 $IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $EXTIF -p tcp -j LOG --log-level info
 
 But nothing show up in /var/log/messages or anywhere else for that matter. 
 This is on a Redhat 7.3 box.
 Any help, clues, flames, RT(his particular)FM, etc are appreciated.
 
 I read the list, so please don't reply directly in addition to the list 
 resposne.
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jer

 You're missing the NEW state. The initial SYN packet will not match with
 either of the first two rules. It should match the third if it's inbound,
 though.

 You need to insert those logging rules above any ACCEPT, REJECT or DENY
 rules for them to be of any use. Are you sure the packets are hitting the
 box at all? Try moving the log rules to the top of the FORWARD chain,
 introduce logging rules to the PREROUTING, POSTROUTING, INPUT and OUTPUT
 chains, and/or use tcpdump as well to see where the packets are travelling.
 
 Cheers
 Tobias

 Well, you can simply use an rpm tarball (or extract one from a source rpm
 on a machine that has rpm scripts install ""rpm2cpio <file.src.rpm> | cpio
 -dimv"" and ""./configure && make && make install"" as usual. You need db3 or
 db4 development files at least, and once everything installed you'll need
 to initialize your rpm database.

 I think my mail wasn't very clear ;-) My point was that we should continue 
 releasing new rules and removing broken ones (all based on discussions on 
 this list of course) in the 2.4 branch instead of creating a new 2.5 branch 
 everytime we have a bunch of new rules.
 
 A new branch should be openend only if (big) new features are introduced 
 (eg. Bayes) or the interface has changed (spam_level_char=x). As the rules 
 are under fluent development, the user has to update quite regularly. But 
 currently he couldn't be shure if the new release will break anything in 
 his setup (like -F going away). So if we say ""the branches are stable to 
 the outside and just improved under the surface but you have to watch out 
 when you update to a new minor version number"", users and sysadmins could 
 be less reluctant to update.
 
 All just IMHO :o)

 [Destined to be a new reality TV Show?]
 
 
 Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire
 Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ET
 
 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger
 hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the
 International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and
 World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire
 of police, who fear demonstrators could damage
 property and wreak havoc.
 
 Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a
 Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.
 Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate
 executive or World Bank delegate.
 
 D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a
 congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities
 were in talks to decide whether planned protests were,
 ""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to
 take proactive action.""
 
 Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate
 outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next
 weekend.
 
 The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based
 anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic
 blockade, banner-drops and protests against major
 corporations in the downtown core.
 
 Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site
 www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,
 told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.
 
 ""People were asking for things to do when they come to
 D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they
 don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said. ""I
 doubt people will actually keep track of what they do
 for points.""

 You could burn a PROM yourself, if you'd wish. I believe that the netboot

","Lucas Gonze:

 Which means the sender has a list of who the true
 targets are, and who the fake targets are, and
 scripts for mixing these. On the receiving side,
 my email client distinguishes between messages
 that are read, and messages that are not. I like
 to mark or save messages that are particularly
 interresting or important to me. And even if I
 make a point to delete ""suspicious material""
 immediately upon reading it, even THAT might
 leave an interesting kind of trace on my machine.
 
 Sorry, but I don't buy the argument that spam
 protects people who want to distribute or see
 material the government disapproves.

 ATTN:ALHAJI
 
 With due respect, trust and humility, I write you this
 proposal, which I believe, would be of great interest
 to you. I am Mrs. regina Rossman, the wife of late Mr.
 Joseph Rossman of blessed memory, before forces loyal
 to
 Major Johnny Paul Koromah killed my husband; he was
 the Director General of Gold and Mining Corporation
 (G.D.M.C.) of Sierra Leone. My husband was one of the
 people targeted by the rebel forces. On the course of
 the revolution in the country, prominent people were
 hijacked from their homes to an unknown destination.
 
 Two days before his death, he managed to sneak a
 written message to us, explaining his condition and
 concerning one trunk box of valuables containing
 money, which he concealed under the roof. He
 instructed me to take our son and move out of Sierra
 Leone, immediately to any neighboring country. The
 powerful peace keeping force of the (ECOMOG)
 intervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by
 the rebels, which was the order of the day.
 Eventually, it resulted into full war, I became a
 widow overnight, helpless situation, without a partner
 at the moment of calamity, and every person was
 running for his life. My son and I managed to escape
 to South Africa safely with the box and some documents
 of property title.
 
 The cash involved inside the box was US$30 Million
 (Thirty Million United States Dollars). Due to fear
 and limited rights as a refugee, I deposited the items
 with a private security company in order not to raise
 an eyebrow over the box here in South Africa in my
 sons name JOEL R. ROSSMAN. Be informed that the real
 content of the box was not disclosed. Meanwhile, I
 want to travel out of South Africa entirely with this
 money for investment in your country because of
 political and economic stability and for future
 benefit of my child.
 
 
 I want you to assist us claim this box from the
 security company and get the money into your private
 account in your country so that we can invest the
 money wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding
 investment and good relationship with you.
 
 
 Concerning the money, we are prepared to give you
 reasonable percentage of 30% for your kind assistance.
 Also, we have decided to set aside 5% of the total sum
 for expenses that might be incurred by the parties in
 the course of the transfer both locally and
 externally. For the interest of this business, do not
 hesitate to contact my son Mr. JOEL R. ROSSMAN on the
 above e-mail address immediately you
 receive this message for more information and to
 enable
 us proceed towards concluding all our arrangements. No
 other person knows about this money apart from my son
 and I. We await your most urgent response.please we
 need your fax/phone numbers for esiear communication.
 
 Thanking you for your co-operation and God bless you.

 Hi, Ben,
 
 it seems, the RH freetype package should be repacked,
 see for this
 https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=74415
 
 Please, can you atach and send your sucessfully rebuild of the RH freetype
 rpm with the bytecode enabled to me?

647,"Subject: asynchronous I/O (was Re: Gasp!)
","Of course we've had select() since BSD 4.2 and poll() since System V
 or so, and they work reasonably well for asynchronous I/O up to a
 hundred or so channels, but suck after that; /dev/poll (available in
 Solaris and Linux) is one approach to solving this; Linux has a way to
 do essentially the same thing with real-time signals, and has for
 years; and FreeBSD has kqueue.
 
 More details about these are at
 http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/
 
 None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlap
 disk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, just
 use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O.
 
 POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most
 proprietary Unixes implement.  The Linux kernel hackers are currently
 rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to
 work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient
 synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other
 way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too.
 
 It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying
 things like ""Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any
 idea at all how the hardware functions,"" but he's totally off-base.
 People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but
 apparently some don't, so I'll rebut.
 
 Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the
 original stupid errors.
 
 In detail, he wrote:
 > Could it be? After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally

 > nontrivial apps? No way!
 
 Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years
 ago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussing
 for many years.  Very few applications need the aio_* calls ---
 essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them
 at all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with
 multiple threads or processes.  This just provides a modicum of extra
 performance.

 Readers can judge who lacks the clue here.

 Although I don't have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIs
 come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is
 13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice.
 They might be even older than that.
 
 Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations
 have supported multithreading for a decade or more.
 
 > Bottom line is the ""do stuff when something happens"" model turned

 > is not really working so great anymore.
 
 Linux's aio_* routines can notify the process of their completion with
 a ""signal"", a feature missing in Microsoft Windows; a ""signal"" causes
 the immediate execution of a ""signal handler"" in a process.  By
 contrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such
 as completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process
 polls them.
 
 I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case
 (although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the
 technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards.
 Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous
 network I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal
 queue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().

 Gimme a break.  This is remarkable for its lack of
 newsworthiness.
 
 1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and
 still are) the best way to read paper tape at high speed.
 You can read about it in the standard accounts, e.g.
   http://www.picotech.com/applications/colossus.html
 
 2) For decades before that, codebreakers were using optical
 computing in the form of superposed masks to find patterns.
 You can read about it in Kahn.
 
 3) People have been doing opto-electronic computing for
 decades.  There's a lot more to it than just holography.
 I get 14,000 hits from
   http://www.google.com/search?q=optical-computing
 
 > Optical info is a complex-valued wave (spatial frequency, amplitude and

 It isn't right to make it sound like three numbers (frequency,
 amplitude, and phase);  actually there are innumerable
 frequencies, each of which has its own amplitude and phase.

 Some things that are hard with wires are easy with
 light-waves.  But most things that are easy with wires
 are hard with light-waves.

 Not ""FFTs"".  FTs.  Fourier Transforms.  All you need for
 taking a D=2 Fourier Transform is a lens.  It's undergrad
 physics-lab stuff.  I get 6,000 hits from:

 All optical???  No optoelectronics anywhere???
 That's medicinal-grade pure snake oil, USP.
 
 Photons are well known for not interacting with
 each other.  It's hard to do computing without
 interactions.

 change on uninstall, though.  So people who are installing this RPM and
 are unfortunate enough to have a DVD drive (or just an ordinary CD,
 non-DVD drive) that doesn't support DMA will be left with a system
 without a working CD drive, even after removing the RPM.  And without
 ever knowing what struck them.  You can't remove the DMA setting from
 modules.conf either unless you're sure that ogle added it there and
 nothing else needs it.
 
 The /dev stuff isn't that dangerous, but the modules.conf change can
 be.  That's why ""Eek"" :)

 How about splitting the creation of the symlinks and modules.conf
 modifications into a separate RPM?

 Say you have installed synaptic-0.24-fr1 on your Valhalla box (package
 rebuilt for Valhalla). Then you upgrade to Psyche using the Red Hat CDs.
 Hopefully with the compat libraries the package will still be there
 (although I doubt that since C++ is binary incompatible, so this is
 probably a bad example), then you ""apt-get update"" with the new Psyche
 repository... and there's where the problem will be : It will say that
 there are two synaptic-0.24-fr1 packages (one installed, the other
 available) with the same version but different dependencies :-/
 That's why I always keep package versions lower for older distributions.

 **Dublin**: something from the archives.    Daev Walsh forwards an article from
 The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''.  This story is also immortalised
 in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billy
 was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I
 now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely
 legal, way to make money.

 LinkText: Billy in the Bowl
 
 From:         daev <hellshaw@fringeware.com>
 Subject:      The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler
 
 A story of my new neighbourhood...
 
 
 The Irish Digest July 1964
 
 
 The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler
 
 The handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.
 Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life 
 
 DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the
 architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of
 beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of these
 beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one
 who campaigned among the working class.  This was ""Billy In The Bowl""
 
 The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means
 of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this ""
 bowl "", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground
 with wooden plugs, one in each hand.
 
 Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been
 born without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing
 him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an
 unusually handsome face.
 
 This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating
 sympathetic passers-by from their small change.
 
 The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many
 lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century
 Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would
 come along.
 
 He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his
 black curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a
 handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.
 
 ""Billy in the Bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily
 owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were
 substantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could
 indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.
 
 As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.
 The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening
 as dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing
 through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on
 Dublin's North Quays.
 
 When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a
 ditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the
 beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.
 
 Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay
 concealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two
 powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.
 
 In a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy
 was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's
 purse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was
 found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her
 assailant.  And, as ""Billy in the Bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a
 deformed beggar.
 
 Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting
 the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.
 
 On one occasion "" Billy in ""the Bowl "" tried his tactics on a sturdy
 servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to
 strangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder
 and caused a great stir.
 
 Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months
 ""Billy in the Bowl"" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this
 period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first
 case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.
 
 Months passed and  ""Billy in the Bowl"" reverted once again to his old
 pasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and
 robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a
 nightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled
 along in his ""bowl"" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that
 finished Billy's career of crime.
 
 Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment
 after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to
 hear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the
 ditch.
 
 Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and
 tried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,
 however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.
 
 Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her
 large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.
 
 The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the
 district and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member
 of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.
 
 ""Billy in the Bowl"" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but
 they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The
 Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive
 Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed
 and giggled as they wended their way home at night.

656,"Subject: The MIME information you requested (last changed 3154 Feb 14)
","--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 What is MIME?
 
 MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"".  It is the
 standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the
 world-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending
 images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text
 files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part
 of the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a
 recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. 
 
 How can I read a MIME message?
 
 Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use
 which do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing
 number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular
 MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the
 University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host
 ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)
 
 In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation
 capability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do
 not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is
 still hope! 
 
 There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME
 message.  One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"".  It was developed
 at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the
 host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions
 available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with
 older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also
 decode messages in split-uuencoded format. 
 
 Does MIME replace UUENCODE?
 
 Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so
 that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical
 limitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust
 encoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the
 message transformations made by certain email gateways. 
 
 How can I learn more about MIME?
 
 The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via
 anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: 
                                                        
      o  US East Coast                            
         Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)        
                                                         
      o  US West Coast                            
         Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)      
                                                         
      o  Pacific Rim                              
         Address:  munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)  
                                                         
      o  Europe                                   
         Address:  nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) 
 
 Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt

 In the 2.4 kernel source Documentation/Configure.help there are various kernel 
 options CONFIG_JFF* that enable it.
 
 http://developer.axis.com/software/jffs/ and http://sources.redhat.com/jffs2/

 Definitely increasing per month.  Percentage-wise:  2002-09 has 1212
 spams in it, so 59/1212 is about 4.8%.  Last month was 3.6%.

","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85534626
 Date: Not supplied
 
 After discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa, Steven 
 ""Hackers"" Levy interviewed lawmen, academics and WiFi activists about the 
 legality and ethics of using open wireless access points. 
 
     I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed 
     this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. ""The FBI wouldn't 
     waste resources on that,"" he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would 
     be hard to argue that I broke a law. What's more, I certainly didn't feel 
     illegal. Becauseand this is the point of all that war-driving and 
     -chalking and node-stumblingwhen you get used to wireless, the experience 
     feels more and more like a God-given right. One day we may breathe 
     bandwidth like oxygenand arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.

 Here's a fix that I think will make a real difference.
 
 Ftoc_ShowSequences needs to be able to be called with an optional list of msgids 
 to update and if it's called that way it only removes or adds tags for those 
 messages.  Then in places like MsgChange, we only update the messages which have
 changed.
 
 Also, a separate Ftoc_ShowSequence function which only updates the display of 
 one sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids.  
 In a place like MsgChange, it would only need to update the cur sequence.
 
 If nobody else gets to it, I'll do this when I get back.
 
 Chris

","Didn't we just have a discussion on FoRK how hard
 it is nowadays to write something that's not
 buffer overflow protected?

 IM client vulnerable to attack 
 IM client vulnerable to attack 
 
 James Pearce, ZDNet Australia  
 
 Users of messenger client Trillian are vulnerable to attack, according to
 information security analyst John Hennessy.
 
 Hennessy has published a proof-of-concept showing the latest version of
 Trillian, v0.73, is vulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack that will
 allow individuals with malicious intent to run any program on the
 computer.
 
 Trillion is a piece of software that allows you to connect to ICQ, AOL
 Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger and IRC with a single
 interface, despite some companies actively avoiding messenger
 interoperability.
 
 According to Jason Ross, senior analyst at amr interactive, in June 2002
 there were 28,000 home users of Trillian in Australia, about 0.4 percent
 of the Internet population, and 55,000 people using it at work, about 1.8
 percent of the Internet population.
 
 David Banes, regional manager of Symantec security response, told ZDNet
 Australia the code appeared to be valid.
 
 ""With these sort of things you have to find some process that would
 accept a connection, then throw loads of random data at it and get it to
 crash,"" he said. ""Once it's crashed, you can try to find a way to exploit
 it.""
 
 He said the proof-of-concept that was published is designed to run on
 Notepad, but could be easily modified to run any program on the system.
 He said the problem was easy to fix by ""writing protective code around
 that particular piece to more closely validate the data around that
 piece.""
 
 ""Because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out the
 checks and balances you should put in, which is why we have all these
 buffer overflows and exploits out there now,"" said Banes.
 
 Cerulean Studios, creator of Trillian, was contacted for comment but had
 not responded by the time of publication.

 Yeah, that would work, tho there are race conditions and likely/possible
 ugly side effects (eg unintentionally left-over comp files).  I've ended
 up taking a very different route: TMDA (http://www.tmda.net).  In
 particular I use TMDA outbound filters to add custom plus addresses to
 the messages I send to specific lists.
 
 For example, for the tmda-users list I want a From: address of
 claw+tmda@kanga.nu, so the relevant outbound filter is:
 
  to tmda-users@libertine.org ext=tmda
 
 which rewrites my From: header transparently.  When I get next month's
 batch of password reminders from Mailman lists I'll be running about
 resubscribing to each list either with a standard plus address or a
 TMDA-based sender address (ie an address which only the list in question
 is able to send mail to).
 
 				  -+-
 
 Getting TMDA fully happy with nmh was a minor pain.  
 
 Reasons:
 
   nmh, like MH, by default delivers outbound mail via SMTP to port 25 on
   a defined host.  The port number cannot be configured (it calls
   getservbyname() which does a lookup against ""smtp"" in /etc/services).
   Ergo, you are constrained to use tell nmh to use tmda-sendmail instead
   of SMTP.
 
   Using sendmail as the delivery method under MH instead of SMTP is not
   recommended as is loses a number of useful bits of robustness in mail
   delivery failure modes.  Further, when nmh is configured to use
   sendmail instead of SMTP nmh's whom tool calls sendmail as follows:
 
     .../sendmail/ -m -t -i -bv
 
   which creates problems:
 
     Postfix does not support ""-bv"" and returns in error
 
     Exim does not support ""-t"" with ""-bv"" and returns in error
 
     Don't mention Qmail.  I won't use it.
 
   ""whom"" is far too useful as a component tool in MH to lose.  
 
     It would be nice if someone gave the new crew working on nmh a shout
     about this.  The ""-bv"" option to sendmail is pretty damned close to
     being Allman sendmail specific and thus unfriendly to other MTAs.
     Further there are many cases where it would be useful to configure a
     non-standard port to deliver outbound mail to via SMTP.  nmh's
     current insistence on only using port 25 (or as specified in
     /etc/services) is a pain.
 
 I've worked out a hack to use TMDA with Exim while retaining nmh's
 ""whom"" support using Exim's system filter:
 
   0) Make sure that the following options are set in ~/.tmda/config:
 
     DATADIR
     ALLOW_MODE_640
     CRYPT_KEY_FILE
     FINGERPRINT
 
   1) chgrp everything in and under ~/.tmda to group ""mail"".
 
   2) Configure Exim as per the current TMDA HOW-TO.
 
   3) Set the following options in exim.conf:
 
     message_filter = ""/etc/exim/filter""
     message_filter_pipe_transport = address_pipe
 
   4) /etc/exim/filter reads:
 
     # Exim filter
     testprint ""local_part: ${local_part: $h_From:}""
     testprint ""domain: ${domain: $h_From:}""
     if ""$h_X-tmda-fingerprint:"" is """" and 
        ""${domain: $h_From:}"" is ""kanga.nu"" and
        ""${if exists {/home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda} {true}{false}}"" is ""true""
     then
       pipe ""/usr/bin/tmda-inject -c /home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda/config""
       finish
     endif
 
   Yes, that assumes that all user directories are under /home and that
   they use ~/.tmda/config instead of ~/.tmdarc.  Hack appropriately for
   your setup.
 
 Basic explanation:
 
   Exim sends all outbound mail thru the system filter (if one is
   configured) before attempting delivery.  The above system filter
   extracts the user from the From: address and pipes the message thru
   that user's TMDA setup via tmda-inject.
 
   The system filter runs as the same user as Exim, thus the requirement
   for the chgrp mail.  If your Exim installation runs as a different
   user, chgrp as appropriate.
 
   It should be fairly easy to do something similar under Postfix, but I
   haven't investigated that end.
 
 Notes:
 
   This requires that all outbound mail that is to be processed with TMDA
   has a From: header which references a local user (suffixes are fine),
   and that the From: address is fully qualified with a known domain.  If
   you're vhosting the above setup would be fairly trivial to extend for
   other domains and $HOME paths.  I'm not vhosting on my desktop and so
   don't care.  You could also qualify on envelope or other headers if
   you wish.
 
   A nice side effect of this approach for those running shared mail
   servers is that ALL users who have TMDA configs instantly get TMDA
   support for their outbound mail -- and in a manner that is less
   complex and less prone to end-user error than the typical TMDA
   configuration.
 
 Caveat Emptor.  
 
   ObNote: I've also written a small patch against TMDA 0.58 to add a
   ""hold"" delivery method (identical to ""confirm"" except it sends no
   confirmation requests -- very useful for testing configs or doing
   silent sidetracking of mail).

 No, that would be rather silly. There are conflicting reports on whether
 Zambia is prepared to accept milled GM grain or not - and, from reports from
 various sources, considerable debate within that country. There's complex
 issues, not all of which can be dismissed by blaming those nasty

 [last message before I unsub]
 
 It's a very poor comparison.
 
 There is no question as to what Ebay's trust model is. It's
 completely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to
 see. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for
 themselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.
 
 Contrast this with TeS which utilizes ""sooper secret"" methodologies to
 determine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point
 something becomes spam at some level of ""confidence.""
 
 The unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly
 ineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I've done indicates about
 a 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don't count as spam,
 apparently because I'm not trusted enough, or enough people haven't submitted
 the item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to
 waste their time submitting items when they aren't being accepted due to
 a series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.
 
 Any trust model that cannot survive public scrutiny isn't worth trusting IMHO.

 Although my fingerprints are all over that, it's not actually my code and has 
 been in there since before 1998.  (It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to 
 sequences.tcl and back again).  I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a 
 one-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages 
 removed.  (I think.)

 That *was* a problem, but if you look at Mh_Sequence (and Mh_Sequences and 
 Mh_SequenceUpdate), they all call MhReadSeqs to do the actual reading and it 
 only reads the sequences if the file has been touched.  Look for the 
 ""Exmh_Debug Reading $filename"" output in the debug log to see when sequences 
 are actually reread from disk.
 
 
 My theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often.  I'm about to 
 investigate that.

701,"Subject: Mathematics film-festival in October in Berkeley
","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85516333
 Date: Not supplied
 
 All through October, Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute is 
 hosting Cinemath, a mathematics film festival: 
 
     Permutations and Configurations: A Calculated Cinema 
 
     In this avant-garde subset of Cinemath, we explore films that have been 
     constructed using mathematical concepts both simple and complex- geometric 
     permutations, musical frameworks, even topography are among the strategies 
     that have been employed to compose and sequence film frames. Filmmakers 
     such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest 
     avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming 
     abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce 
     dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics 
     are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances 
     such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the 
     viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of 
     machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James 
     and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary 
     animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry 
     Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish 
     Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, 
     while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously 
     calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, 
     and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to 
     graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no 
     mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to 
     try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!

 Michael's Minute: Do the Math...Dispel the Myths 
 
 A reporter came by the Lindows.com <http://www.lindows.com/>  offices
 last Friday. He told me that he wanted to try and use
 <http://www.lindows.com/lindows_products_lindowsos.php> LindowsOS to
 write a story, but he didn't think it was possible because his office
 used Microsoft Word .doc files. I asked him to have a seat and watch.  
 
 I turned on the Walmart.com <http://www.lindows.com/walmart> computer
 and then clicked on the running man  <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse>
 which took me to the Click-N-Run Warehouse
 <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse>  where I installed OpenOffice
 <http://www.lindows.com/openoffice>  using Click-N-Run. I then clicked
 the ""Run It""  button which opened the word processor OpenOffice Writer.
 I then typed ""Linux is ready for the desktop and consumers can save
 hundreds using LindowsOS."" I selected ""Save as Microsoft Word.""
 
 The reporter was not only surprised, he was amazed. Like many reporters,
 he was under the impression that Linux was only for servers. The simple
 word processor demonstration went a long way to show him otherwise. For
 Linux to become a driving force in desktop computing it will have to
 overcome a couple of myths. 
 
 The first myth is that Linux is too hard to install and configure. That
 may have been true in the past, but we've annihilated this myth with the
 latest version of LindowsOS --which installs on most machines in under 5
 minutes. It's point- and-shoot easy - easier than any other operating
 system (Microsoft products included). See for yourself at <http://www.tryoutlinux.com/> .  
 
 The other myth is that Linux is just for the server and none of the
 graphical programs --which desktop users have come to rely on-- exist.
 Not only have many of the Linux software programs made quantum leaps
 over the last couple of years, but they've gotten quite good at reading
 and writing Microsoft formats. The easiest way to experience these
 products is via the Click-N-Run  <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse>
 Warehouse.
 
  Here's a quick list of some of the quality programs available today in
 the Warehouse <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse> all downloaded and
 installed with a single click:
 
 OpenOffice - This one installation will equip a computer with an
 impressive collection of productivity programs each of which will open
 the corresponding Microsoft file format and allow you to edit files and
 swap them with Microsoft counterparts. <www.lindows.com/openoffice>
 Programs included are:
 
 OpenOffice Writer - Word processor (reads Microsoft Word docs) 
 OpenOffice Calc - Spreadsheet (reads Microsoft Excel) 
 OpenOffice Impress- Presentation package (reads Microsoft PowerPoint)
 OpenOffice Draw - A vector based drawing program
 
 Click here <http://www.lindows.com/openofficeflash>  for a great
 tutorial on getting to know OpenOffice.
 
 GIMP <www.lindows.com/gimp> If you are familiar with Adobe's Photoshop,
 you'll want to Click-N-Run GIMP. It's a powerful image editor. 
  
 
 Evolution <www.lindows.com/evolution> For those used to Microsoft's
 Outlook email program Evolution will make them feel right at home. Check
 out how easy it is to use <http://www.lindows.com/evolution> .
 
 Flowchart Pro, which is similar to Microsoft's Visio, is a  rich
 charting program that makes it possible to create flow charts and
 organizational charts, plus more. See how easy it for yourself, visit
 Flowchart Pro at <http://www.lindows.com/flowchartpro>
 
 This is just a handful of the quality programs available in the
 Warehouse <www.lindows.com/warehouse> that make Linux a practical choice
 for the desktop today. And if you're still not convinced, then do the
 math.
 
 <http://www.lindows.com/walmart> 
 For  a total cost of $499 <http://www.lindows.com/walmart> , including
 all  software, computer users save  more than $800  for a complete
 system. 
 
 With such major price differentials between the two similarly equipped
 systems, any business, school or home will find their computing dollars
 stretched much further running LindowsOS.

 First you complain about the supposed lack of threading
 in Internet Mail, and then you reply to one of the messages
 in that thread on an unrelated topic, messing things up for
 those of us with threading turned on?
 
 Even Outlook Express does threading!
 
 Sigh...

     ZDNET DELIVERS Price-Feature Analysis	Vol 1, No. 2
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 This week, we present a special shopper report featuring
 four cool products. We have reviewed these products,
 compared each to five products with similar features,
 and analyzed the range of prices for each category. What
 you'll see is a shopper tool we've dubbed the ""Price-Feature
 Ratio Analysis."" Featured products can fall in to three
 stages of Price-Feature ratios:
 
 Stage 1: High Price-Feature Ratio - Technophiles will rush
 to buy the product, but can expect to pay higher prices
 for the honor of being the first among their friends to have one.
 
 Stage 2: Variable Price-Feature Ratio - Expect high variability
 in prices among products with similar features. It pays to
 comparison shop for the best price.
 
 Stage 3: Low Price-Feature Ratio - When compared to products
 with similar features, prices are low and don't vary much
 from merchant to merchant. Use our merchant ratings to
 find the right one for you.
 
 We have rated each of the products featured in this supplement
 to aid your shopping experience.

 KDS Rad-5 15-inch LCD
 
 The Lowdown: Without our even hitting the power button, the
 stylish KDS Radius Rad-5 stands out from the pack with its
 silver casing and blue highlights. Turn on this basic,
 analog-only LCD and you'll see an equally impressive image
 at its native resolution of 1,024x768.

 Perl Journal. I just heard from the SysAdmin editors. Ad revenues are
 down so much that all tech mags are apparently in dire straits, and
 SysAdmin has basically been taking a big loss on TPJ for a while now; and
 the money people say that it just can't keep doing that. So the issue
 that's in the mail now is apparently [2]the last.""

 Tech's Major Decline
 College Students Turning Away From Bits and Bytes
 
 By Ellen McCarthy
 Washington Post Staff Writer
 Tuesday, August 27, 2002; Page E01
 
 If John Yandziak had been entering college a few years ago, he might have
 sought a stake in the ""new"" economy. He might have dreamed of becoming an
 ace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined
 toppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to
 use the Internet to end world hunger.
 
 But as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboring
 different academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do
 something more social and more interesting than working with computers.
 
 Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, ""you
 can't get the chicks with that anymore.""
 
 The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of
 some fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the tech
 bust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has
 come to a halt.
 
 The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in
 2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And
 educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some
 colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.
 
 The word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickled
 into the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of
 Computing Machinery.
 
 ""I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic
 declines,"" said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering
 at Princeton University in January. ""It can be hard to see this, because at
 some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far
 exceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect.""
 
 At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science
 department will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington
 University, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer
 science fell by more than half this year.
 
 Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the
 past decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and
 computer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing
 Research Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees
 were awarded.
 
 The Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the
 fastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other
 computer-related industries trailing close behind.
 
 But in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among
 college students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying
 information technology and engineering at George Mason University were
 computer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is
 down to 800, although a newly created and more general information
 technology major has attracted 200 students.
 
 ""Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,"" said Lloyd Griffith,
 dean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school.
 ""Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend four
 years on something and then not get a job.""
 
 Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science major
 is expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland
 decreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does
 not account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College of
 Computer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
 
 ""We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their
 interest in pursuing computer science as a major,"" Halperin said. ""That's a
 factual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expect
 to see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no
 longer expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off.""
 
 Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not
 convinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,
 with a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his
 advanced-placement exam in computer science.
 
 ""All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,
 so I looked for professions in which I could use those things,"" Yandziak
 said. ""I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I
 want to do something that will contribute to the practical world.""
 
 Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
 America, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,
 salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.
 
 ""There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have the
 same sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need this
 kind of IT training right now,' "" Miller said. ""Our concern as an industry
 is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the
 road four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to
 find themselves in a shortage situation.""
 
 Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other
 factors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social
 influences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional
 development at the American College Counseling Association. The perception
 of computer science as an isolating, ""nerdy"" profession is one that many in
 the industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during
 the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.
 
 ""All the hipness is gone,"" Yandziak said. ""Once we thought of the Internet
 as this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that
 came along.""
 
 Lamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in
 the District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business
 marketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.
 
 ""Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,""
 Thompson said. ""To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I
 think of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's a
 necessity, but I wouldn't take it any further.""

                   <p>Do you sell on eBay? If so, you could be making up
 to $100,000 per month.<br>
                   <br>
                   This is no hype and no scam. Receiving over 1.5 billion page views per
 month, eBay is the ULTIMATE venue for selling virtually anything and making
 huge profits with almost no effort. But you have to know what to sell and
 how to sell. That's where I come in.<br>
                   <br>
                   As a leading expert in internet marketing and the owner of several profitable
 auction-based businesses, the manual that I have written provides easy to
 understand and detailed instructions for maximizing your profits with selling
 strategies that are PROVEN WINNERS.<br>
                   <br>
                   If you've read any other books on eBay, you know that all of them are designed
 for the computer idiot and the auction novice. They tell you how to register,
 how to list an item, how to avoid fraud, etc. This is not the information
 you need to make millions on eBay. You need to learn effective SELLING STRATEGIES
 not read a photocopy of eBay help files! My manual assumes that you already
 know your way around eBay; you don't need any specialized computer knowledge,
 but you should be familiar with buying and selling on eBay auctions. I'm
 not going to waste your time teaching you how to register - I'm going to
 pass on the SECRET SELLING TECHNIQUES that I use each and every day to bring
 in hundreds of thousands of dollars selling my products on internet auctions.
 The manual comes as a complete course with the following lessons:</p>

 Well, I think my avifile build still needs the win32 codecs to be able to
 run (manually copied into /usr/lib/win32/), but personally, I've been very
 happy with mplayer's default (which is ffmpeg's ffdivx decoder) for nearly
 all the DivX files I used. The only ones that still require (from my own
 experience) the use of the win32 codecs are the ones encoded with a strange
 DivX 3 sound format... and I've really not seen any quality or speed
 improvements when using them.

 <font size=""+1""><b>IT sees new profits in Old Glory</b></a></font><br>
 
 
 
 
 Can CRM be tweaked to track terrorists? As the fight against <b>terrorism</b> heats up, the government turns to the tech industry to come up with tools to secure the country against attack. It's an opportunity for patriotism--and for profits. (Nearly $38 billion is slated for homeland security.) <b>Software companies</b>  are sending tens of thousands of proposals to government agencies, some of which are so new they don't have the budget to hire people to evaluate them all.

 <font size=""+1""><b>Are Spam blocklists going too far?</b></a></font><br>
 
 Many businesses are turning to spam-filtering tools to regain
 control of their e-mail boxes. But legitimate e-mails are being 
 deleted, too, now that <b>sometimes-indiscriminate blacklists</b> have
 become a key weapon in the war against unsolicited bulk e-mail.
  Companies
 subscribe to the lists, bouncing any traffic directed to their
 servers that originates from those addresses. Is <b>overkill</b> the
 answer to stopping spam? What is your company doing to stop
 junk e-mail?

 Note that timtest.py's current tokenizer only looks at decoded text/* MIME
 sections (or raw message text if no MIME exists); spammers could put
 megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn't even be looked at
 (except that the email package has to parse non-text/* parts well enough to
 skip over them, and tokens for the most interesting parts of Content-{Type,
 Disposition, Transfer-Encoding} decorations are generated for all MIME
 sections).
 
 Schemes that remain ignorant of MIME are vulnerable to spammers putting
 arbitrary amounts of ""nice text"" in the preamble area (after the headers and
 before the first MIME section), which most mail readers don't display, but
 which appear first in the file so are latched on to by Graham's scoring
 scheme.
 
 But I don't worry about clever spammers -- I've seen no evidence that they
 exist <0.5 wink>.  Even if they do, the Open Source zoo is such that no
 particular scheme will gain dominance, and there's no percentage for
 spammers in trying to fool just one scheme.  Even if they did, for the kind
 of scheme we're using here they can't *know* what ""nice text"" is, not unless
 they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their
 messages to each different one.  At that point they'd be doing targeted
 marketing, and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously.

 I don't know if there's a sendmail-ish way (it's not in the -d0.1 output),
 but this should work:
 
 $ strings `which sendmail` | grep -i milter
 
 If you get a long list of function/message looking phrases, milter
 is built-in.  If you get something like:
 
 Warning: Filter usage ('X') requires Milter support (-DMILTER)
 Milter Warning: Option: %s requires Milter support (-DMILTER)
 @(#)$Id: milter.c,v 1.1.1.2 2002/03/12 18:00:36 zarzycki Exp $
 
 then it's not built-in. :)

736,"Subject: business intent
","Dear Sir,
 
 I am Stanley Woodwork, the secetary of Africa White farmers
 co-operation (AWFC) OF Zimbabwe. After the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president Mr. Robert Mugabe won the presidential election, the
 government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme. This programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white African farmers for redistribution to black africans. This programme has attracted worldwide
 condemnation from world leaders including British prime minister,mr Tony Blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of
 victimization and physical abuse.
    Two weeks ago, our headquartes in Harare was attacked and
 looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building. Fortunately,they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which
 belong to the co-operation. This cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government.
    Now I have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe. The cash in question is US$46Million dollars.
    Once I can get your commitment and sincerity of investing
 this funds on our behalf then I would proceed to get the funds freighted to Europe, where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us.
    You do not have anything to worry about as I would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe, and the business proposal is 100% legal and risk free.
    You would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe.
 Please get back to me if you can be of assistance and I would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government.
    I expect 100% confidentiality and your prompt response to
 this mail so as to proceed.you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork@email.com
 
 
 Kind regards,
 
 Stanley Woodwork.

 No...the list has been on target i'd say about 95% of the time.
 Iff it starts being a problem, consider it. Right now, John's
 right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove
 requests have in the entire past year.
 
 One thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's
 adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message
 indicating where to email to remove. The catch: the mail is
 not sent to ""majordomo"" - it is sent to ""listname-remove""@domain.
 I've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail
 addr I used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in
 a received message, and I have multiple addresses going to the
 same box).
 
 For all that, remember, even if you put the actual removal
 instructions right in the bottom of your email, you will
 _still_ get the clueless asking you how to remove. (Trust me,
 we've been there.)

   Based on your description the whole thing would be 1 part.
 
   If your mail contains a fwd of a mail *inline* with mime boundaries, 
   then your mail is all consindered to be just text.  If you fwd
   the mail as attachment, the attachment is considered to be a separate
   part  - but the attachment is not broken down further for

","Since libdvdcss-1.2.0, I have been unable to play DVDs using ogle, xine,
 vlc, or mplayer.  They all show a scrambled picture with (VERY) choppy
 audio.  When I run xine I see tons of these in the console:

 Has anyone seen this before and know how to fix it?  Or should I file a
 bug report?  
 
 Thanks for your help.

746,"Subject: [ILUG] PNP collision avoidance question
","Hi all,
       I have an ISA PNP card that will use io 0x200 if available.  If located at
 0x200 the card never works, at 0x210 it always does.  I suspect the problem is
 the soundcard (Creative SB PCI-64) gameport controller, which also seems to live
 here.  I'm not using the controller, so it doesn't show in /proc/ioports, so
 autodetect happily puts my ISA card there.
       I can get the card to work easily enough using isapnptools, banning the
 0x200 range in /etc/isapnp.gone, and then using ""insmod radio-cadet io=0x210"",
 but I'd like to get the autodetect working, so what I think I'm looking for is
 some way of adding ""don't go here, don't bother me"" entries into /proc/ioports.
 
 Anybody?
 
 TIA,
 Ronan.

 Quite some modules from CPAN do have a line like this nowadays (I think or 
 read so somewhere, respectively). And the Perl error message is very clear: 
 ""ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
 Makefile.PL line 2.""

 I could think of a solution: We could remove the ""use"" line and add the 
 version to PREREQ_PM. After WriteMakefile() we could add the lines 
   require ExtUtils::MakeMaker; 
   ExtUtils::MakeMaker->VERSION(5.45); 
 to do per hand what 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl 
 Makefile.PL` will die with a ""Uncaught exception from user code: 
 ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
 Makefile.PL line 103."" there but we've got a Makefile. But I don't know if 
 CPAN will run the make anyway...

 We could call the preprocessor on install time. That's not a very clean 
 approach but could work. 
  
 We can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the Makefile directly per postamble. We 
 already have a useless line ""pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made"" there. Adding 
 some commands in this section gives some make warnings (""Makefile:933: 
 warning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib' Makefile:877: warning: 
 ignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib'"") but does work. Not a very good 
 solution either.

 The ""use MakeMaker::..."" error message is IMHO quite clear, so I think it's ok 
 to require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils::MakeMaker before the SA 
 installation. But that's just my opinion ;-) 
  
 I'll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution. They should know.

 Lennon killer seeks parole again
 
 The man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for
 early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's
 62nd birthday.
 Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the
 superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980.
 It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from
 Attica state prison.
 At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and
 had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the
 ex-Beatle.
 Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star.
 Shot dead
 Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New
 York City apartment on 8 December 1980.
 He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session
 during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice.
 Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from
 Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as
 Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him.
 The killer said Lennon had been just ""a picture on an album cover"" to him
 before the shooting.
 'Deserved death'
 Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his
 crime.
 Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if
 Chapman were released.
 Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the
 Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled
 commercial success.
 The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would
 have been 62 on Wednesday.

749,"Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??
","i agree with rob. i think if the phones (and mms is building traction in europe in handsets), this might be interesting. bottom line is will it a) help sell phones and b) bill enough time on the wcarriers networks?
 
 anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad? low quality, small in size. but kids totally dug that stuff. seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point. and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography - developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch - more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them.

 I think this is probably the best way, because I think (maybe) with upgrading you
 do not always automatically get the latest feature enabled in some config file
 because RH would rather take it easy and not update that config file (you get a
 rpmnew instead of rpmsaved file) so they get less calls to support that way.
 
 Anyway, I have tons of media files in /home/* probably 5 to 10 gigs at least, my
 laptop's CDROM takes 700MB at a time (obviously) and compressing media files is
 dumb because they are already compressed. Dumb question: how to backup huge data?
 Network backup to another box? I do not have a box with a tape drive, but maybe box
 with a large HD with much free space could take the backup (oops, I do not have a
 space computer with a large HD with much free space).
 
 These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! Yes I learned that
 used CDs make inexpensive backup copy on the shelf. I do not want to re-rip all
 this crap again.

 Without addressing the overpopulation argument, the more bureaucracy,
 the more opportunity for corruption. If a corporation is corrupt,
 there are generally, absent more government intervention,
 alternatives. With bureacracy that is more difficult; one generally
 most uproot oneself and move.

 None for that ""builds"" part : It's just an export of the CVS tree in which

 I think the filemtime() php function that Ville uses in his sript is what

 Security in cyberspace is a different kettle of fish compared to many computer 
 systems. Cyberspace entertainment only has to be useful to the majority of its 
 users --entertaining. That means it can tolerate a small amount of vandalism 
 still remain useful. This is quite unlike a system required for commerce. We 
 still have a headache of course, but at least we only need to keep the system 
 around 90 percent clean, rather than 99.99 percent. Of course well still 
 strive to stamp out corruption, but our system failure threshold is more 
 achievable than one might at first assume.

 Uh, zero.  I'm sort of offended at having to take this question seriously,
 like being black and having to actually explain that black people don't
 all sing and dance.  I'd guess that gay men compared to straight men have
 a linearly greater number of sexual partners on the order of 1.5-2X.  But
 then again, it not a monolithic or homogeneous community.  Who knows?

762,"Subject: GPL limits put to a test
","
 XviD [1] is a project to make GPL divx codecs. Sigma Designs [1] is a
 company  looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things,
 divx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not very
 gpl. The  results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users to
 put preasure  on Sigma to honor the GPL.
 
 Some notes from other places....
 
 >>From Doom9 [3]
 ""XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4
 Video Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project.
 Soon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developers
 have contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for those
 who don't know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL -
 which demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release it
 under the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigma
 codec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolen
 code, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only
 disguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was once
 again contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today
 nothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the public
 in the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince
 Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter has
 been resolved XviD development will not continue.
 
 That being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads about
 the Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now.
 Internally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authors
 first wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes
 and kept quiet about the matter at hand.
 
 [Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of
 the source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it's already up for download.
 However, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press release
 makes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so we
 might be hearing more about this.
 
 [Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but it
 also looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviD
 doesn't get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collides
 with Sigma's Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign before
 downloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they'd
 fully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn's relationship with
 Sigma didn't really work out either, as Sigma's Xcard is not as DivX
 compatible as it was advertised.
 
 [Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigma
 source code does not mean it's all over, it's far from being over. The
 license agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and
 install the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can now
 clearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself)
 that the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all the
 copyright notices of the original developers have been removed and
 replaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - you
 can't just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright
 statements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on
 your own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code taken
 from the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 different
 copyright notices which is quite funny.""

 Maybe.  I batch messages using fetchmail (don't ask why), and adding

 Movable Type 2.5 is out. I'm running it and it appears to work. It incorporates 
 many suggestions from Dive Into Accessibility[1], a book which was written in 
 and is still powered by Movable Type. I find this amusing in a self-referential 
 sort of way. 
 
 The other big change is the inclusion of MT-search to allow users to have their 
 own site search. Every web site needs a site search[2]. Existing MT-search 
 users should merge the contents of mt-search.cfg into mt.cfg, change 
 ""TemplateDir"" to ""SearchTemplatePath"", and (if you use alternate templates) 
 change ""AltTemplate1"", ""AltTemplate2"", ""AltTemplate3"", etc. to ""AltTemplate"". 
 They should all just be ""AltTemplate"".

 I've an XMMS Alsa module I've been using for a while now at:
 http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsa-xmms-0.9_cvs020630-aap1.i686.rpm
 http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsa-xmms-0.9_cvs020630-aap1.src.rpm
 http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsa-xmms-0.9_cvs020630.spec
 
 Also there is alsaplayer rpms there too:
 http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.i386.rpm
 http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.i686.rpm
 http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.src.rpm
 http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71.spec
 
 Good luck. Both were build on an RH 7.3 box with errata current as of the date of
 the build. I'm running (null) RH beta now and I recall that alsa-xmms still works, I
 can not remember if alsaplayer needs a --rebuild.
 
 As an aside, alsaplayer is really maturing into a versitile app, I've been packaging
 for many releases now.
 
 I've scripted the alsa-xmms cvs build, so it's easy to spin another one if these
 rpms do not work on (null).

 Tell me what keystroke made it happen so I can reproduce it and I'll see what 
 I can do about it (or if I can't, I'll hand it off to Brent).

 In my experience, this is classic ""American"" behaviour, and I don't 
 think its on the increase outside of the US of A.
 I am willing to accept the premise that Americans are bigger dickheads

 Being that I have a print subscription to PocketPC Magazine, 
 I haven't been by their website in quite some time, so when 
 Hal Goldstein informed me of a new electronic delivery 
 method that they've employed, I felt obligated to give it a 
 spin. You can check out the September 2002 Issue of the <a 
 href=""http://www.pocketpcmag.com/digital/default.asp"">Digital 
 Edition</a> and see if you like reading the mag in that 
 format better than the print variety. A Software and 
 Accessories Encyclopedia is also new to the site since my 
 last belated visit.
 
 <p>I've also been using my PocketPC quite a bit lately, but 
 not for data. It's found a more frequent home on my belt as 
 an MP3 player ever since Diana's dad gave us a bicycle. 
 Going out for a morning ride has been quite pleasurable, and 
 it's nice to bring along some tunes. I've tried both the 
 Compaq iPaq 3870 and HP Jornada 565, and have been more 
 pleased with the audio ability of the iPaq, due in part to 
 the sound utility Compaq provides to adjust treble and bass 
 levels. It's just a more full-sounding device, in my 
 opinion.

 <b>LDAP Whodunit</b>
 <br>Pondered by Warren Dugas
 
 <p>""Randy, a little question for you: Do you know what LDAP is and how important it is to the world of technology? I'm sure you do - but where did it come from? Hmm, let's put our thinking caps on and try to figure it out. Did Microsoft create it? Hmm - No, how about Novell? Nope. Well, who then?""
 
 <p>History of LDAP 
 
 <p><a class=""url"" href=""http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winntas/evaluate/featfunc/ldapcmr.asp"">http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winntas/evaluate/featfunc/ldapcmr.asp</a>
 
 <p>X.500, the OSI directory standard, defines a 
 comprehensive Directory Service, including an information 
 model, namespace, functional model, and authentication 
 framework. X.500 also defines the Directory Access Protocol 
 (DAP) used by clients to access the directory. DAP is a full 
 OSI protocol that contains extensive functionality, much of 
 which is not used by most applications. 
 
 <p>DAP is significantly more complicated than the more 
 prevalent TCP/IP stack implementations and requires more 
 code and computing horsepower to run. The size and 
 complexity of DAP makes it difficult to run on thin clients, 
 such as the PC and Macintosh where TCP/IP functionality 
 often comes with the machine. DAP stack implementations are 
 cumbersome to administer, thus limiting the acceptance of 
 X.500. Hence in 1993, the folks at University of Michigan, 
 with help from the ISODE Consortium, designed and developed 
 a protocol that would work over TCP/IP and was small enough 
 when implemented to run on a thin client like PC's running 
 the Windows operating system or the Macintosh. 
 
 <p>The LDAP version 1 Specification was published in March 
 of 1994. The LDAP version 2 Specification was published as 
 rfc 1777 by the Access Searching and Indexing of Directories 
 (ASID) working group in the IETF in March of 1995. In April 
 of 1996, 40 companies including Microsoft, Netscape, and 
 Novell separately announced support for LDAP protocol in 
 their Directory Services products in order that they may in 
 turn operate with each other and integrate with the 
 Internet. LDAP version 3.0 has gone through several drafts 
 but at this time is not finished.

 <b>Looking for Sound</b>
 <br>Suggested by Corey Hollett
 
 <p><a class=""url"" href=""http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/santacruz/whatdoineed.asp"">http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/santacruz/whatdoineed.asp</a>
 <br><a class=""url"" href=""http://www.3dsoundsurge.com/reviews/earlyimpressions/ProMedia51.html"">http://www.3dsoundsurge.com/reviews/earlyimpressions/ProMedia51.html</a>
 
 <p><i>""I've just gone on an extensive hunt for the best 
 sound card and speaker set combination for 5.1 sound. My 
 criteria were that it be excellent for games, music, and dvd 
 playback. A price under $500.00 was also a strong 
 point.""</i>
 
 <p>Corey came to the same conclusion that others have in two 
 respects. Creative has long maintained a healthy share of 
 the sound card market with a solid name and decent products. 
 Audiophiles know of other brands as well, such as Turtle 
 Beach and Philips, which also produce quality sound cards 
 and at attractive price points. Corey decided on the Turtle 
 Beach Santa Cruz card, a great choice. 
 
 <p>His choice of speaker systems reinforced my own feelings 
 on the subject. I own two Klipsch speaker sets, the ProMedia 
 2.400 and most recently the ProMedia 5.1. The 2.400 system 
 was the subject of many positive reviews, and believe me 
 when I say that the ProMedia 5.1 leaves the 2.400 in the 
 dust. The above review that Corey pointed out hits the high 
 points, and is actually quite in-depth for an ""initial"" 
 review. I'm itching to see if they eventually do write up a 
 more complete version, as mentioned in the article.

 <b>QuickTime 6 Released</b>
 
 <p><a class=""url"" href=""http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/</a>
 
 <p>With the debut of QuickTime 6, we can assume that the 
 licensing haggles over MPEG-4 have been resolved, making way 
 for the long-awaited release. MPEG-4 isn't the only 
 addition, joining a new AAC audio codec that is a favorite 
 among professionals. Streaming media skip protection, Flash 
 5 support and better AppleScript functionality also tag 
 along. As always, there is a standard free version available 
 for download, but the Pro edition adds additional features, 
 such as full screen video playback, the ability to create 
 MPEG-4 content and editing features not present in the free 
 player.

 <b>Microtel & WalMart Love Linux</b>
 
 <p><a class=""url"" href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26192.html"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26192.html</a>
 
 <p>WalMart is selling Microtel PCs, but with a slight twist. 
 They were one of the first manufacturers to preinstall 
 LindowsOS and offer systems to the retail market through 
 WalMart.com, and now Mandrake is being offered as a pre-
 installed choice in operating systems. These options give 
 potential Linux users an easier way to get started without 
 having to build their own system from scratch or deal with 
 driver issues, while still maintaining a low overall cost. A 
 Pentium 4 2GHz system with a CD-RW drive goes for as little 
 as $648 with Mandrake Linux, so not too shabby at all.

788,"Subject: Ack, apt-get still failing for me, stumped. [RH8]
","
 I posted about this last week, and I'm still stumped.  apt-get is just
 not working for me, and I can't figure out what the problem is.
 
 I've tried removing the apt rpms, making sure to remove any traces left
 behind (/etc/apt /var/state/apt /var/cache/apt), and still, I get
 ""couldn't find package xmms-mp3"" when running ""apt-get install xmms-mp3"".
 
 Any clues?  Here's a log of a fresh try:

","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85513616
 Date: Not supplied
 
 The new ish of Strange Horizons in out, with an interview with Bloodhag, the 
 most metal of the all the science fiction metal bands. 
 
     Soon, the spotlight comes up again. The lead singer grabs the microphone. 
     ""This is Frank Bellknap Long!"" he yells, and, feverish, launches into a 
     lecture on Long's oeuvre. There can't be more than a handful of people on 
     this earth who could get a beer-sodden thrash crowd to listen to an English 
     Lit lecture. Thirty seconds later, the audience is sufficiently educated, 
     and the guys begin to wail. Jake the singer holds the microphone over his 
     head and belts out the song in a growling voice that's monster-movie low. 
     ""No reason! No corners!"" he shouts. Two minutes later, they're done with 
     the pulps and ready to move on to the New Wave. ""Our next song is about 
     Harlan Ellison!"" Jake bellows, and the geeks, the hipsters, the metalheads, 
     and the drunks let out a howl of mutual joy. 
 
     Bldhag -- note the dual umlauts -- hails from Seattle. Describing 
     themselves as ""edu-core,"" the band performs nothing but two-minute thrash 
     tributes to science fiction writers. Between songs, the band pelts the 
     audience with paperback books, quizzes them on book titles, and demands 
     that the audience show their library cards. Their motto: ""The Faster You Go 
     Deaf, the More Time You Have to Read.""

 I assume that you won't %ghost or remove these and the modules.conf
 change on uninstall, though.  So people who are installing this RPM and
 are unfortunate enough to have a DVD drive (or just an ordinary CD,
 non-DVD drive) that doesn't support DMA will be left with a system
 without a working CD drive, even after removing the RPM.  And without
 ever knowing what struck them.  You can't remove the DMA setting from
 modules.conf either unless you're sure that ogle added it there and
 nothing else needs it.
 
 The /dev stuff isn't that dangerous, but the modules.conf change can
 be.  That's why ""Eek"" :)

 How about splitting the creation of the symlinks and modules.conf
 modifications into a separate RPM?

 Officially no. But also on my ftp://people.redhat.com/ckloiber page is
 rpms for the rar-3.00 file archiving/unarchiving program. This is
 distributed as a binary tarball only, and I repackaged it based
 originally on an earlier version of rar I found on the net, just for
 practice. It also makes use of subpackages, and I was both proud of
 myself for getting it to work, and sickened that I repackaged
 binary-only crap. Enjoy.

795,"Subject: RE: Goodbye Global Warming
","""the historical record"", by which you mean *human* historical record, is
 highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological
 timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.
 
 My problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that the
 supposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absolute
 terms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noise
 floor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last
 50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rate
 of temperature change.  People unfamiliar with history of global
 temperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degree
 here or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that global
 temperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity.  I therefore 
 immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain why
 temperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the last
 couple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geological
 standards).  This is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to use
 climate to push a particular social agenda.
 
 It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited
 during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of
 humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers
 paved over their civilization.  The receding glaciers have turned into a
 bit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried
 in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the
 ice for thousands of years.  I don't see any compelling reason to ""save
 the glaciers"" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their
 existence has always been transient.
 
 For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are
 anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I'll
 just stick with Occam's Razor for now.
 
 In my humble opinion.
 
 Cheers,
 
 -James Rogers

 I've been working on salary related things the past few days, but I'm starting 
 to think about exmh again.
 
 Thanks to Robert for finding that s/$L/$lineno/ bug.
 
 So, has anybody else been looking at the performance issues that we were 
 talking about before I left, or should I dig right in?

 THE NEXT WORLD ORDER
 by NICHOLAS LEMANN
 The Bush Administration may have a brand-new doctrine of power.
 Issue of 2002-04-01
 Posted 2002-03-25
 
 When there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new people
 often persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyone
 suspected. This feeling seems especially intense in the Bush
 Administration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by a
 father-son team. It's easy for people in the Administration to believe
 that, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family has
 resumed its governance-and about time, too.
 
 The Bush Administration's sense that the Clinton years were a waste, or
 worse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs.
 Republicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense and
 foreign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of as
 Clinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline.
 Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article in
 Foreign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clinton
 of ""an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the
 commander in chief."" Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this
 Administration also served under the President's father. They took office
 last year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswatting
 by Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they'd left off.
 
 Not long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administration
 foreign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the Oval
 Room. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whose
 cover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of the
 world, and these words:
 
 Defense Strategy for the 1990s:
 The Regional Defense Strategy
 Secretary of Defense
 Dick Cheney
 January 1993
 
 One of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is
 communicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even elected
 politicians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then perform
 publicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
 are just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard,
 and are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is go
 to meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, to
 explain that some of the documents, including the report that the senior
 official handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from a
 high-school term paper, represent the government version of playing
 Carnegie Hall?
 
 After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary of
 Defense, set up a ""shop,"" as they say, to think about American foreign
 policy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whose
 existence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, at
 a higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of
 Defense; Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff; and Eric Edelman, a senior
 foreign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group of
 conservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, and
 intellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (Donald
 Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and has
 been closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) Colin
 Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted a
 competing, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagine
 American foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on which
 each team would brief Cheney for an hour; Cheney would then brief President
 Bush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling the
 new grand strategy.
 
 Everybody worked for months on the ""five-twenty-one brief,"" with a sense
 that the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz and
 Powell arrived at Cheney's office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, but
 his briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who,
 perhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn't
 get to present his alternate version of the future of the United States in
 the world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush,
 using material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his major
 foreign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day that
 Iraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed.
 
 The team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of the
 material, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagon
 envisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, prevent
 any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks of
 controversy ensued about the Bush Administration's hawks being
 ""unilateral""-controversy that Cheney's people put an end to with denials
 and the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material.
 
 As it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheney
 team's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that the
 senior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before
 Clinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a ""scrubbed,""
 meaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained the
 essential ideas of ""shaping,"" rather than reacting to, the rest of the
 world, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one of
 skepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of the
 same ideas can be found in a short book titled ""From Containment to Global
 Leadership?,"" which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney's team in 1991 and
 is now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into the
 Clinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends that
 the United States ""preclude the rise of another global rival for the
 indefinite future."" Khalilzad writes, ""It is a vital U.S. interest to
 preclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessary
 for the purpose.""
 
 When George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people around
 him didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines of
 the policy of containment of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence which
 the United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first major
 foreign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that ""a
 President must be a clear-eyed realist,"" a formulation that seems to
 connote an absence of world-remaking ambition. ""Realism"" is exactly the
 foreign-policy doctrine that Cheney's Pentagon team rejected, partly
 because it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominating
 world affairs for any length of time.
 
 One gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terrorist
 attacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking.
 Any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bush
 has done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domestic
 security. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are truly
 entering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are that
 Bush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new,
 aggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change in
 direction rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric,
 especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congress
 since September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind which
 his aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment of
 destiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging,
 because it enhances Bush's stature and opens the way to more assertive
 policymaking.
 
 Inside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been ""a
 transformative moment,"" as the senior official I had lunch with put it, is
 not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials
 had previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the American
 public's usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, at
 least for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the ""Black
 Hawk Down"" operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on the
 conviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombing
 Kosovo operation, in Clinton's next-to-last year, was the ideal foreign
 military adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, the
 options are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999
 study of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies,
 which argued that the ""mass public"" is much less casualty-averse than the
 military or the civilian lite believes; for example, the study showed that
 the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to
 prevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The American
 death total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September
 11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further.
 
 Recently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice's
 Foreign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: ""The United
 States has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest'
 in the absence of Soviet power."" I asked her whether that is still the
 case. ""I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role,"" she said
 immediately. ""I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakes
 that clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief."" Like Bush,
 she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons
 of mass destruction ""in the hands of irresponsible states"" now define the
 national interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush's speech to
 Congress on September 20th, America's sole grand purpose was ending
 terrorism.) We talked in her West Wing office; its tall windows face the
 part of the White House grounds where television reporters do their
 standups. In her bearing, Rice seemed less crisply military than she does
 in public. She looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind of
 missionary calm, rather than belligerence.
 
 In the Foreign Affairs article, Rice came across as a classic realist,
 putting forth ""the notions of power politics, great powers, and power
 balances"" as the proper central concerns of the United States. Now she
 sounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that Cheney's
 Pentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that the
 other great powers are now in harmony with the United States, because of
 the terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. ""Theoretically, the
 realists would predict that when you have a great power like the United
 States it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to
 challenge it or trying to balance against it,"" Rice said. ""And I think what
 you're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move to
 productive and coperative relations with the United States, rather than to
 try to balance the United States. I actually think that statecraft matters
 in how it all comes out. It's not all foreordained.""
 
 Rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the
 National Security Council and asked them to think seriously about ""how do
 you capitalize on these opportunities"" to fundamentally change American
 doctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. ""I
 really think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947,"" she said-that is,
 the period when the containment doctrine took shape-""in that the events so
 clearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a big
 global threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally
 thought of as being in the coalition. That has started shifting the
 tectonic plates in international politics. And it's important to try to
 seize on that and position American interests and institutions and all of
 that before they harden again.""
 
 The National Security Council is legally required to produce an annual
 document called the National Security Strategy, stating the over-all goals
 of American policy-another government report whose importance is great but
 not obvious. The Bush Administration did not produce one last year, as the
 Clinton Administration did not in its first year. Rice said that she is
 working on the report now.
 
 ""There are two ways to handle this document,"" she told me. ""One is to do it
 in a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. But it's our view that,
 since this is going to be the first one for the Bush Administration, it's
 important. An awful lot has happened since we started this process, prior
 to 9/11. I can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but I
 would think sometime this spring. And it's important that it be a real
 statement of what the Bush Administration sees as the strategic direction
 that it's going.""
 
 It seems clear already that Rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant
 American role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. Some
 questions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously being
 asked, are how much the United States is willing to operate alone in
 foreign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engender
 inside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. The leak a
 couple of weeks ago of a new American nuclear posture, adding offensive
 capability against ""rogue states,"" departed from decades of official
 adherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication of
 the scope of the reconsideration that is going on. Is the United States now
 in a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the Middle East,
 and replacing governments by force? Nobody thought that the Bush
 Administration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly it
 is, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few
 months ago.
 
 Just before the 2000 election, a Republican foreign-policy figure suggested
 to me that a good indication of a Bush Administration's direction in
 foreign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, Paul Wolfowitz or
 Richard Haass. Haass is another veteran of the first Bush Administration,
 and an intellectual like Wolfowitz, but much more moderate. In 1997, he
 published a book titled ""The Reluctant Sheriff,"" in which he poked a little
 fun at Wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (he
 called it the ""Pentagon Paper"") and disagreed with its idea that the United
 States should try to be the world's only great power over the long term.
 ""For better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach,"" Haass wrote. ""It
 simply is not doable."" Elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another of
 the Wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the United States expanding the
 ""democratic zone of peace"": ""Primacy is not to be confused with hegemony.
 The United States cannot compel others to become more democratic."" Haass
 argued that the United States is becoming less dominant in the world, not
 more, and suggested ""a revival of what might be called traditional
 great-power politics.""
 
 Wolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than Haass: he is Deputy Secretary of
 Defense, and Haass is Director of Policy Planning for the State Department-
 in effect, Colin Powell's big-think guy. Recently, I went to see him in his
 office at the State Department. On the wall of his waiting room was an
 array of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff,
 beginning with George Kennan, the father of the containment doctrine and
 the first holder of the office that Haass now occupies.
 
 It's another indication of the way things are moving in Washington that
 Haass seems to have become more hawkish. I mentioned the title of his book.
 ""Using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreign
 policy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case
 to make,"" he said. ""It was written when Bill Clinton was saying, 'It's the
 economy, stupid'-not 'It's the world, stupid.' Two things are very
 different now. One, the President has a much easier time making the case
 that foreign policy matters. Second, at the top of the national-security
 charts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.""
 
 I asked Haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as
 Kennan's containment. ""I think there is,"" he said. ""What you're seeing from
 this Administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of
 ideas-I'm not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call the
 limits of sovereignty. Sovereignty entails obligations. One is not to
 massacre your own people. Another is not to support terrorism in any way.
 If a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some of
 the normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left alone
 inside your own territory. Other governments, including the United States,
 gain the right to intervene. In the case of terrorism, this can even lead
 to a right of preventive, or peremptory, self-defense. You essentially can
 act in anticipation if you have grounds to think it's a question of when,
 and not if, you're going to be attacked.""
 
 Clearly, Haass was thinking of Iraq. ""I don't think the American public
 needs a lot of persuading about the evil that is Saddam Hussein,"" he said.
 ""Also, I'd fully expect the President and his chief lieutenants to make the
 case. Public opinion can be changed. We'd be able to make the case that
 this isn't a discretionary action but one done in self-defense.""
 
 On the larger issue of the American role in the world, Haass was still
 maintaining some distance from the hawks. He had made a speech not long
 before called ""Imperial America,"" but he told me that there is a big
 difference between imperial and imperialist. ""I just think that we have to
 be a little bit careful,"" he said. ""Great as our advantages are, there are
 still limits. We have to have allies. We can't impose our ideas on
 everyone. We don't want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others to
 join us. American leadership, yes; but not American unilateralism. It has
 to be multilateral. We can't win the war against terror alone. We can't
 send forces everywhere. It really does have to be a collaborative endeavor.""
 
 He stopped for a moment. ""Is there a successor idea to containment? I think
 there is,"" he said. ""It is the idea of integration. The goal of U.S.
 foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to
 certain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition to
 terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade,
 democracy, markets. Integration is about locking them into these policies
 and then building institutions that lock them in even more.""
 
 The first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a new
 American foreign policy will be the effort to remove Saddam Hussein. What
 the United States does in an Iraq operation will very likely dwarf what's
 been done so far in Afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of the
 operation itself and in terms of its aftermath.
 
 Several weeks ago, Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress,
 the Iraqi opposition party, came through Washington with an entourage of
 his aides. Chalabi went to the State Department and the White House to ask,
 evidently successfully, for more American funding. His main public event
 was a panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi's
 leading supporter in town, Richard Perle, the prominent hawk and former
 Defense Department official, acted as moderator. Smiling and supremely
 confident, Perle opened the discussion by saying, ""Evidence is mounting
 that the Administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing
 with Saddam Hussein."" The war on terrorism, he said, will not be complete
 ""until Saddam is successfully dealt with. And that means replacing his
 regime. . . . That action will be taken, I have no doubt.""
 
 Chalabi, who lives in London, is a charming, suave middle-aged man with a
 twinkle in his eye. He was dressed in a double-breasted pin-striped suit
 and a striped shirt with a white spread collar. Although he and his
 supporters argue that the Iraqi National Congress, with sufficient American
 support, can defeat Saddam just as the Northern Alliance defeated the
 Taliban in Afghanistan, this view hasn't won over most people in
 Washington. It isn't just that Chalabi doesn't look the part of a rebel
 military leader (""He could fight you for the last petit four on the tray
 over tea at the Savoy, but that's about it,"" one skeptical former Pentagon
 official told me), or that he isn't in Iraq. It's also that Saddam's
 military is perhaps ten times the size that the Taliban's was, and has been
 quite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. The United
 States left Iraq in 1991 believing that Saddam might soon fall to an
 internal rebellion; Chalabi's supporters believe that Saddam is much weaker
 now, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could
 finish him off. But non-true believers seem to be coming around to the idea
 that a military operation against Saddam would mean the deployment of
 anywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand American ground
 troops.
 
 Kenneth Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst who was the National Security
 Council's staff expert on Iraq during the last years of the Clinton
 Administration, recently caused a stir in the foreign-policy world by
 publishing an article in Foreign Affairs calling for war against Saddam.
 This was noteworthy because three years ago Pollack and two co-authors
 published an article, also in Foreign Affairs, arguing that the Iraqi
 National Congress was incapable of defeating Saddam. Pollack still doesn't
 think Chalabi can do the job. He believes that it would require a
 substantial American ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the one
 we used in Kuwait in 1990-91 than to the one we are using now in
 Afghanistan.
 
 Pollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given a
 briefing or two in his day. When I went to see him at his office in
 Washington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and
 walked over to his office wall, where three maps of the Middle East were
 hanging. ""The only way to do it is a full-scale invasion,"" he said, using a
 pen as a pointer. ""We're talking about two grand corps, two to three
 hundred thousand people altogether. The population is here, in the
 Tigris-Euphrates valley."" He pointed to the area between Baghdad and Basra.
 ""Ideally, you'd have the Saudis on board."" He pointed to the Prince Sultan
 airbase, near Riyadh. ""You could make Kuwait the base, but it's much easier
 in Saudi. You need to take western Iraq and southern Iraq""-pointing
 again-""because otherwise they'll fire Scuds at Israel and at the Saudi oil
 fields. You probably want to prevent Iraq from blowing up its own oil
 fields, so troops have to occupy them. And you need troops to defend the
 Kurds in northern Iraq."" Point, point. ""You go in as hard as you can, as
 fast as you can."" He slapped his hand on the top of his desk. ""You get the
 enemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once."" His
 hand hit the desk again, hard. ""Then you crush him."" Smack.
 
 That would be a reverberating blow. The United States has already removed
 the government of one country, Afghanistan, the new government is obviously
 shaky, and American military operations there are not completed. Pakistan,
 which before September 11th clearly met the new test of national
 unacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass
 destruction), will also require long-term attention, since the country is
 not wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of Daniel
 Pearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligence
 service, may not be entirely under the control of the President. In Iraq,
 if America invades and brings down Saddam, a new government must be
 established-an enormous long-term task in a country where there is no
 obvious, plausible new leader. The prospective Iraq operation has drawn
 strong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, Russia, is a
 nuclear superpower. An invasion would have a huge effect on the internal
 affairs of all the biggest Middle Eastern nations: Iran, Turkey, Saudi
 Arabia, and even Egypt. Events have forced the Administration to become
 directly involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it hadn't wanted
 to do. So it's really the entire region that is in play, in much the way
 that Europe was immediately after the Second World War.
 
 In September, Bush rejected Paul Wolfowitz's recommendation of immediate
 moves against Iraq. That the President seems to have changed his mind is an
 indication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the Administration's
 conservatives. ""These guys are relentless,"" one former official, who is
 close to the high command at the State Department, told me. ""Resistance is
 futile."" The conservatives' other weapon, besides relentlessness, is
 intellectualism. Colin Powell tends to think case by case, and since
 September 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least
 the beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptance
 practically requires invading Iraq. If the United States applies the
 doctrines of Cheney's old Pentagon team, ""shaping"" and expanding ""the zone
 of democracy,"" the implications would extend far beyond that one operation.
 
 The outside experts on the Middle East who have the most credibility with
 the Administration seem to be Bernard Lewis, of Princeton, and Fouad Ajami,
 of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, both of whom
 see the Arab Middle East as a region in need of radical remediation. Lewis
 was invited to the White House in December to brief the senior
 foreign-policy staff. ""One point he made is, Look, in that part of the
 world, nothing matters more than resolute will and force,"" the senior
 official I had lunch with told me-in other words, the United States needn't
 proceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the ""Arab street,"" as long as it is
 prepared to be strong. The senior official also recommended as interesting
 thinkers on the Middle East Charles Hill, of Yale, who in a recent essay
 declared, ""Every regime of the Arab-Islamic world has proved a failure,""
 and Reuel Marc Gerecht, of the American Enterprise Institute, who published
 an article in The Weekly Standard about the need for a change of regime in
 Iran and Syria. (Those goals, Gerecht told me when we spoke, could be
 accomplished through pressure short of an invasion.)
 
 Several people I spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of the
 nations that loudly oppose an invasion of Iraq would privately cheer it on,
 if they felt certain that this time the Americans were really going to
 finish the job. One purpose of Vice-President Cheney's recent diplomatic
 tour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamely
 absorbing all the public criticism of an Iraq operation. In any event, the
 Administration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of
 the world's approval. When I spoke to Condoleezza Rice, she said that the
 United States should assemble ""coalitions of the willing"" to support its
 actions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure
 of international treaties and organizations. An invasion of Iraq would test
 that policy in more ways than one: the Administration would be betting that
 it can continue to eliminate Al Qaeda cells in countries that publicly
 opposed the Iraq operation.
 
 When the Administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it asked
 for a forty-eight-billion-dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal
 2003, which begins in October, 2002. Much of that sum would go to improve
 military pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated as
 an unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on
 terrorism. That's probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of
 Iraq.
 
 This spring, the Administration will be talking to other countries about
 the invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while Bush
 builds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the
 unacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. A drama
 involving weapons inspections in Iraq will play itself out over the spring
 and summer, and will end with the United States declaring that the terms
 that Saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions,
 are unacceptable. Then, probably in the late summer or early fall, the
 enormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. The
 Administration obviously feels confident that the United States can
 effectively parry whatever aggressive actions Saddam takes during the troop
 buildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize Iraq enough to cause the
 Republican Guard, the military key to the country, to turn against Saddam
 and topple him on its own. But the chain of events leading inexorably to a
 full-scale American invasion, if it hasn't already begun, evidently will
 begin soon.
 
 Lewis (Scooter) Libby, who was the principal drafter of Cheney's
 future-of-the-world documents during the first Bush Administration, now
 works in an office in the Old Executive Office Building, overlooking the
 West Wing, where he has a second, smaller office. A packet of
 public-relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of
 his 1996 novel, ""The Apprentice,"" quotes the Times' calling him ""Dick
 Cheney's Dick Cheney,"" which seems like an apt description: he appears
 absolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result of
 the influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravelly
 rumble. Like Condoleezza Rice and Bush himself, he gives the impression of
 having calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction
 which the Administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for
 those charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the only
 truly prudent course.
 
 When I went to see Libby, not long ago, I asked him whether, before
 September 11th, American policy toward terrorism should have been
 different. He went to his desk and got out a large black loose-leaf binder,
 filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the Middle
 East. He looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer.
 
 ""Let us stack it up,"" he said at last. ""Somalia, 1993; 1994, the discovery
 of the Al Qaeda-related plot in the Philippines; 1993, the World Trade
 Center, first bombing; 1993, the attempt to assassinate President Bush,
 former President Bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of a
 serious response to that; 1995, the Riyadh bombing; 1996, the Khobar
 bombing; 1998, the Kenyan embassy bombing and the Tanzanian embassy
 bombing; 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks; 2000, the bombing of
 the Cole. Throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the Iraqis,
 and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime; and the
 failure to respond significantly to Iraqi incursions in the Kurdish areas.
 No one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take that
 long list and you ask, 'Did we respond in a way which discouraged people
 from supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against our
 interests? Did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged
 further aggressions against U.S. interests?,' many observers conclude no,
 and ask whether it was then easier for someone like Osama bin Laden to rise
 up and say credibly, 'The Americans don't have the stomach to defend
 themselves. They won't take casualties to defend their interests. They are
 morally weak.' ""
 
 Libby insisted that the American response to September 11th has not been
 standard or foreordained. ""Look at what the President has done in
 Afghanistan,"" he said, ""and look at his speech to the joint session of
 Congress""-meaning the State of the Union Message, in January. ""He made it
 clear that it's an important area. He made it clear that we believe in
 expanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world.
 He made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. And
 he had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and to
 begin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is
 not a change of behavior on their part. Take the Afghan case, for example.
 There are many other courses that the President could have taken. He could
 have waited for juridical proof before we responded. He could have engaged
 in long negotiations with the Taliban. He could have failed to seek a new
 relationship with Pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been so
 afraid of weakening Pakistan that we didn't seek its help. This list could
 go on to twice or three times the length I've mentioned so far. But,
 instead, the President saw an opportunity to refashion relations while
 standing up for our interests. The problem is complex, and we don't know
 yet how it will end, but we have opened new prospects for relations not
 only with Afghanistan, as important as it was as a threat, but with the
 states of Central Asia, Pakistan, Russia, and, as it may develop, with the
 states of Southwest Asia more generally.""
 
 We moved on to Iraq, and the question of what makes Saddam Hussein
 unacceptable, in the Administration's eyes. ""The issue is not inspections,""
 Libby said. ""The issue is the Iraqis' promise not to have weapons of mass
 destruction, their promise to recognize the boundaries of Kuwait, their
 promise not to threaten other countries, and other promises that they made
 in '91, and a number of U.N. resolutions, including all the other problems
 I listed. Whether it was wise or not-and that is the subject of debate-Iraq
 was given a second chance to abide by international norms. It failed to
 take that chance then, and annually for the next ten years.""
 
 ""What's your level of confidence,"" I asked him, ""that the current regime
 will, in fact, change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by?""
 
 He ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke
 slowly and deliberately. ""There is no basis in Iraq's past behavior to have
 confidence in good-faith efforts on their part to change their behavior.""

809,"Subject: Immediate Reply Needed
","Dear Sir,
 
 I am Dr James Alabi, the chairman of contract
 award and review committee set up by the federal
 government of Nigeria under the new civilian
 dispensation to award new contracts and review
 existing ones.
 I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
 reputable person to handle a very confidential
 transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge
 sum of money to a foreign account. 
 
 There were series of contracts executed by a 
 consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in
 favor of N.N.P.C. The original values of these 
 contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum
 of US$12,320,000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand 
 United
 State Dollars). This amount has now been approved and
 is now ready to be transferred being that the
 companies
 that actually executed these contracts have been
 fully Paid and the projects officially commissioned. 
 
 
 Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to 
 transfer the total amount to your account for
 subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants
 are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil
 service law) from operating and/or opening foreign 
 accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust
 reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in 
 return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the 
 transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for
 incidental expenses (internal and external) between
 both parties in the course of the transaction you will
 be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts
 in due course. 
 
 Modalities have been worked out at the highest level
 of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of 
 Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds
 within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of
 the above stated terms. 
 Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To 
 
 accord this transaction the legality it deserves and
 for mutual security of the funds the whole approval
 procedures will officially and legally processed
 with your name or the name of any company you may
 nominate as the bonefide beneficiary. 
 Once more I want you to understand that having put
 in over twenty-five years in the civil service of my
 country, I am averse to having my image and career 
 dented. This matter should therefore be treated with
 utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. 
 
 Please you should signify your intention to assist
 by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this
 transaction, if favorable we will take further steps
 to brief you the full details of this viable 
 transaction. 
 I want to assure you that this business proposal is
 100% risk free as we have done our homework
 properly. 
 
 I quite believe that you will protect our interest
 by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are
 still in government service, which we intend to
 retire from in full honor.
 
 Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to
 enable us include this transfer in the next batch
 which would constitute the new quarter payments
 for the 2002 financial year. 
 
 Thank you and God bless.
 
 Dr James Alabi

 <p>
 
 Draft legislation that is winding its way through Congress would sharply li=
 mit Americans' rights relating to copying music, taping TV shows and transf=
 erring files through the Internet. The first part of their proposal, which =
 would <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D8b-SBGBQY0y2oGDikAEY=

 and nonprofit groups that have reviewed it.
 
 <p>
 
 Under current copyright law, Americans who record a TV program or radio seg=
 ment generally may ""sell or otherwise dispose of"" that analog recording or =
 digital file as they wish.
 
 <p>
 
 The proposed bill would end that exemption, handing copyright owners substa=
 ntial new control over the distribution of their works by curtailing a cons=
 umer's right to copy material under a doctrine known as ""fair use.""
 
 <p>
 
 Another salvo in the copyright battle was delivered when a federal judge sa=
 id that record labels and film studios could <a href=3D""http://clickthru.on=
 line.com/Click?q=3Da0-11h8QQBqNNjxwbcUByjw2PB1s79R"" >expand an ongoing copy=
 right lawsuit</a> to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popula=

 <p>
 
 The Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Associ=

 in Los Angeles federal court. The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Net=
 works, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally=
  created the Kazaa software.
 
 <p>
 
 However, in February, Kazaa BV sold the Kazaa file-swapping software to Sha=
 rman, a company later revealed to be based in Vanuatu, a small island in th=
 e South Pacific. The recording and movie industry trade groups asked permis=
 sion to add that company to the lawsuit in June. A judge ruled this week th=

 Included in the proposal are radical changes for the U.S. government's Inte=

 One of the first cameras that can shuttle photos and videos using the Wi-Fi=
  wireless networking technology has made its <a href=3D""http://clickthru.on=
 line.com/Click?q=3D1f-rvwqI58wtiBX5xU1xmYgHobjqmZR"" >debut</a>. IQinVision =
 plans to sell the camera to companies such as security firms that need to p=
 ut video cameras in places where wires can't go, or as a way to quickly ins=
 tall a temporary security system.
 
 <p>
 
 This product is among the first devices to combine digital videography and =
 wireless LANs (local area networks) that use the Wi-Fi, or 802.11b, standar=
 d. Expect more digital camera makers to follow suit. The number of digital =
 cameras has been on the rise, and it's only a matter of time before a camer=
 a maker wants to add a popular new technology like Wi-Fi.
 
 <p>
 
 Wi-Fi is also <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D34-pJpSIcd8l=
 d53rX23_tvVyn4IcgdR"" >invading handheld devices</a>. Wireless equipment mak=
 er Intersil is working with SyChip to incorporate 802.11b wireless networki=
 ng technology into a Secure Digital (SD) card for handheld devices. The car=
 d, which should be available to manufacturers for testing in the fourth qua=
 rter, lets handheld owners add and remove wireless networking capabilities =
 to handhelds that contain an SD slot from Palm, Hewlett-Packard and other c=
 ompanies.
 
 <p>
 
 Wireless SD cards would make it far easier for handheld manufacturers and o=
 wners to get these devices linked. Only a few handhelds include wireless ca=
 pabilities, and they are some of the most expensive on the market. With the=
  card, wireless access becomes an option for many.
 
 <p>
 
 Not everyone is pleased with the explosion in popularity of wireless networ=
 king. Broadband providers are <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=
 q=3D49-ZM4cIEpSm4ht0v3VX4RVXFO5JSrR"" >cracking down</a> on some customers, =
 threatening to cut service to those who set up the inexpensive wireless sys=
 tems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.
 
 <p>
 
 After being introduced just a couple of years ago, so-called Wi-Fi ""hot spo=
 ts"" that tap into cable or digital subscriber lines (DSL) are now in at lea=
 st 15 million homes and offices. The problem is that one paying subscriber =
 can set up a local network that allows several other people to access the N=
 et, for fun or for profit.

                                stiffening sinews
 
          More hot summer days in the mailinglist alleyways,
          dangerously empty of sane postings, strewn with the rotting
          carcasses of broiling vacation messages. Hacktress and
          Silicon Valley's chief rat-keeper LILE ELAM, excitedly posts
          about a new open 802.11 network she's found. ""I am here at
          the police station waiting to see a judge and I thought I
          would check to see if there is connectivity"", she writes,
          somewhat recklessly, to the Bay Area Wireless list. Exit
          the rest of the Wifi community through the nearest window
          and out into the streets... where, cooling tempers, the
          Microsoft Palladium boys are on an endless summer tour,
          reassuring the experts that while, hmm, they *suppose* Pd
          could *theoretically* be used as a Hollywood DRM system,
          they truly have no plans to do any such thing. Cypherpunk
          and friend of freedom Lucky Green hears this; thinks up four
          or five of the obvious Palladium DRM implementations; sends
          them off to be patented in his name. Licensing funds, we
          imagine, will go on cracking his own DRMs. And so the mail
          loops on.

          fun from the creators of the Scrambling for Safety crypto

          fighting off the audience with a broken chairleg, and other
          epiphenomena of the interzone between legal minds and hacker
          ethics. Oh, and FIPR are still looking for a Programme
          Director, so if you're interested, let them know. We
          suggested a convention raffle (first prize: the director's
          job, second prize: Ross Anderson as your personal slave for

          that this weekend's multimedia performance of Jeff Wayne's WAR 
          OF THE WORLDS has been postponed due to ""health and safety 
          issues"". The event was to feature computer graphics, 
          fireworks, ""60ft-tall Martian fighting machines"" wreaking 
          ""havoc and destruction"", and - most terrifyingly of all - the 
          possibility of a David Essex tribute singer performing with 
          Hawkwind, but UKP18 tickets for the Sat 2002-08-31 show at 
          Manchester's Heaton Park will still be valid at a range of new 
          venues next summer. Ironically, the Martians' original 
          invasion plans were similarly thwarted by health and safety 
          issues, ""slain after all man's devices had failed by the 
          humblest creatures that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this 
          earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. For, directly

           The respective trademark holders will hate this, but
           Windows really *is* like the Sun. You have this big hulking
           mass of concentrated power in the middle, with a few small
           orbiting utilities - like WinZip, and PuTTY, and VNC.
           Occasionally one will get a bit too close to the OS, and
           Microsoft will suck it down and turn it into fuel for the
           System. One such discrete satellite remains FILEZILLA, the
           still-necessary ftp gui client for Windows. Those who know
           it won't need the introduction, although they might
           appreciate the note that it's getting close to v2.0 time.
           For dogged WS_FTP users, though, it's got multiple
           downloads, auto-restart of interrupted 'loads, queuing, and
           sftp and Kerberos support. It's also GPL'd which makes it a
           nice bit of source for anyone wanting to grok Win32
           networking from something that works.

819,"Subject: [Razor-users] Reducing impact from tons of email
","I'm not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail
 problem. Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning
 FreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my
 wife's web site with Apache server running on it and a few other
 services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we
 get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On
 occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a
 reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in
 which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see
 over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an
 occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.
 
 I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated
 with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,
 to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor
 files. So I have just added ""-home /etc/razor"" as an argument. I
 haven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether
 this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This
 paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph
 above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)
 
 At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email
 processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there,
 perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?
 
 Any ideas would be welcome.
 
 Thanks,
 Joe

821,"Subject: apt and a hybrid system
","Back when I had regular RH7.3 there was nothing better than ""apt-get upgrade"". But
 now I'm running (null) beta and I have these questions:
 
 which version of ""apt"" can I use, the RH7.3 version or the ""rawhide"" version?
 
 Is there a way to use apt to update (null) with the rpms available for (null)
 through up2date, since I prefer apt to that?
 
 If I can use apt, can I use it to get updates from these 3 different places:
 1. the (null) up2date Redhat upgrades
 2. the (null) files at Freshrpms.net
 3. the regular RH7.3 files from freshrpms.net

 SUMMARY
 
 As part of an ongoing NASA/UAH joint project, Dr. John Christy of UAH and Dr. Roy Spencer of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center use data gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration TIROS-N satellites to get accurate, direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the Earth, including remote deserts, rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise available.
 
 The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.
 
 Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a ""public"" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
 
 
 
 GATHERING THE DATA
 
 While traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.
 
 The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their ""brightness"" - varies according to temperature.
 
 Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.
 
 
 
 VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS
 
 A recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a ""remarkable"" level of agreement between the two.
 
 To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by ""radiosonde"" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.
 
 He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054 Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.
 
 ""The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,"" Christy said. ""If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else.""
 
 The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28 Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23 Fahrenheit) per decade.
 
 Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.
 
 ""These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,"" Christy said. ""They are not representative of the total globe.""
 
 Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.
 
 While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.
 
 In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05 C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.
 
 
 
 GLOBAL COVERAGE
 
 One advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.
 
 The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.
 
 The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.
 
 Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.
 
 The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.
 
 Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. ""Radiosonde"" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.
 
 While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.
 
 Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard ""ships of opportunity."" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.
 
 In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.
 
 
 
 INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSU
 
 With nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.
 
 Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.
 
 Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)
 
 To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.
 
 
 
 INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERS
 
 Of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local ""asphalt effect"" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.
 
 
 
 INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITY
 
 While the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.
 
 The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.
 
 Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.
 
 
 
 THE SCIENTISTS
 
 In 1996, Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. They were honored ""for developing a global, precise record of the Earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate.""
 
 AMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.
 
 In 1991, Spencer and Christy received NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.

 Heh. I get to see bad CDROM problems all the time. Mostly when vendors
 buy crap cables to try to save $0.02/each, but there are chipsets and
 drives with known DMA issues as well.

 Usually if you enable DMA on a CDROM that can't handle it gracefully you
 won't be able to read data off it relably, and that's about it. No
 end_of_the_world problems, and easily fixed.
 
 > I guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting

 My biggest beef with automatically setting /dev/dvd is that I always
 seem to have a CD-Burner and a DVD drive (or DVD burner) in the same
 box, and I usually have the DVD as the second drive /dev/cdrom1 in
 ""kudzu-speak"". I agree that the %description is the best place for the
 tip. Unless someone can come up with a way to probe CD/DVD drives to
 divulge their largest supported media size without loading ide-scsi or
 having that media currently in the drive.

 from entering a mail box, not to leave a mail server. altough you could
 probably use it that way i doubt it would do much good (if the mail is
 leaving the server, it most likely is a new spam and wouldn`t get caught
 by
 razor)
 
 you might want to look into dealing with those troublesome users
 directly.
 and (as you`ve probably been screamed at a lot of times) close your open
 relay if you have one, there are plenty of sites that tells you how
 (most
 RBL sites)

 20021003@06:00 PDT [TIX106448] (fwd)
 
 
 Hello,
 
 I have just spoken with an UUnet technician at 11:23 PDT and he was unable
 to provide me with any new information regarding the outage.  He did
 confirm that problems had spread beyond the east coast and are now seen
 nationwide through out their network.  They are currently working with
 their hardware vendor to try and isolate the issue.
 
 A large number of Internap's connections to UUnet remain shutdown and
 traffic is being routed over alternate providers.  The scale of this
 outage is causing a large number of peering points with UUnet and other
 providers to be flooded due to the large traffic shifts.
 
 If you have problems reaching specific sites please send an email to
 noc@internap.com containing a traceroute and source/destination IP
 addresses and we will investigate.  If it is possible will will attempt to
 move specific prefixes onto an alternate provider leaving an Internap PNAP
 if that will provide better performance.
 
 Regards,
 Andrew

 UUnet is currently experiencing a large number of problems in their North
 American backbone.  Internap has been aware of these problems since approx
 06:00 PST.  Most of the problems appear to be concentrated on the East
 Coast but we have reports of problems from other geographic regions.
 
 This is being tracked under Internap ticket 106448 and UUnet master ticket
 651751.
 
 UUnet currently does not have any ETA for a fix for this event.
 
 If you have issues reaching a specific site please send an email to
 noc@internap.com with a traceroute showing the path which has a problem.
 
 Internap has shutdown peerings to UUnet is various cities to help reduce
 the number of problems that customers will experience.
 
 Regards,
 Andrew

 There was a fascinating article in the Economist 1-2 weeks back (the issue
 with a pregnant-looking Statue of Liberty on the Front) that stated that
 even for the native US population, fertility had jumped in the last decade
 and a half. I think the current figure for the US is a little over 2, but
 not quite the ~2.1 of replacement rate. Combined with the very fertile
 non-native population, the article implied the US was going to have a
 significant increase in population over earlier predictions. As well, the
 population would overall be more youthful, with associated implications for
 being able to fund social programs, military spending, consumer spending,
 etc.
 
 Europe did not show the same increase in fertility.
 
 Some actual data for the US are here:

","Adjournment of Michel Fournier's big Jump in May, 2003.
 
 Two attempts of launch failed : the first because of the wind which got up
 prematurely and the second due to a technical hitch during the inflating of
 the envelope.

 opportunity for the launch of the balloon stratosphrique allowing to raise

 capsule pressurized by Michel Fournier at more than 40 000 metres in height.
 As expected, in the date of September 20, the jets stream strengthened in
 300 kph announcing the imminent arrival of the winter and closing until next
 May the meteorological window favorable to a human raid in the stratosphere.
 On the plains of Saskatchewan, the first snows are waited in the days which
 come.Meeting in all in May, 2003.

 Adding -r to the sort options, and piping through head instead,
 might be a better idea. tail needs to read teh whole buffer, head
 only reads the first n lines.

 I believe that's just a matter of string parsing. If someone were to fix
 the openssh package, removing the explicit Requires:, I believe the
 automagic binary handler would figure the right libraries to use and
 install. I haven't met an openssh like that and in worst case I've had 3
 different openssl libraries (WTF can't they just bump a major version if
 it's incompatible?!?).

 02. DISK CLEANUP ON XP.  Windows XP users can do some fast cleaning chores 
 with Disk Cleanup.  Access this tool from the Start menu by right clicking 
 on your hard drive.  Then select Properties and click on the Disk Cleanup 
 button to determine how many files can be safely deleted.
 
 03. THANKS BUT NO THANKS.  Continuing our periodic feature of 
 less-than-useful sites on the Web:  The International Center for Bathroom 
 Etiquette at http://www.icbe.org/ gets our recognition this issue.  It says 
 it's working hard to bring you the latest in cutting edge research and 
 technology regarding bathroom etiquette.  We'll resist some obvious puns.

 West Virginia's Diane Stratton recommended NNT to some friends and is now 
 enjoying QuicKeys 2.0, a great Windows management software package.  Diane 
 is our latest winner and you could be next.  Just go to the NNT Web site at 
 http://www.NeatNetTricks.com and click on ""Recommend NNT.""  Nothing could 
 be easier.

 04. MOUSELESS WAY HOME.  To go home quickly in Internet Explorer, touch F6 
 to highlight the Address Bar and type two periods (..) there.  The Enter 
 key then takes you home.
 
 05. KARTOO.  Search engines are everywhere on the Internet but Kartoo at 
 http://www.kartoo.net is quite unusual.  It's a meta search engine that 
 displays results on a map in the form of a ball.  The larger the ball, the 
 more relevant the result.  As you mouseover each result, site descriptions 
 are revealed.  If all that sounds confusing, the explanation is more 
 complicated than the service itself.  Just try it.
 
 . . . . .
 
 You should make it a habit to visit the NNT Store at 
 http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store . We try to have several great products 
 there at a limited-time price much less than anywhere else on the Net. 
 Currently, you'll find excellent ebooks, a very effective popup stopper, 
 and the very useful utility described in item 01 above, along with the 
 usual opportunity to subscribe to NNT Premium and ArchivesExpress.  Check 
 us out, you'll be glad you did.
 
 . . . . .
 
 06. XP TIME FEATURE.  Windows XP added a nice feature that heretofore 
 required a separate software application.  It will connect, either at a 
 programmed time or manually, to a time server via the Internet and reset 
 that often erroneous internal clock.  Just click on the time in the systems 
 tray, go to Date and Time Properties and click the Internet Time tab.
 
 07. LEAF PEEPER ALERT.  A bit early, but soon the changing colors of autumn 
 will begin here in the U.S.  For those who like to follow the display, 
 consider http://www.stormfax.com/foliage.htm for a comprehensive collection 
 of links and toll-free numbers to each state to determine peak color times.
 
 08. SAVINGS SCRAPS.  Some oldies are worth repeating.  If you're working 
 with text in, for example, MS Word or WordPad, and would like a handy way 
 to save a portion for later easy retrieval, just select (highlight) it and 
 click/drag it to your desktop.  When the newly created icon is clicked on, 
 it will show the application with which the scrap was created, along with 
 the first few words of the text.  A double click opens the text in the 
 application with which it was created.
 
 09. QUICK ACCESS.  To go to a frequently used program, you may find 
 yourself drilling down to the desktop and searching out the shortcut 
 icon.  Consider instead setting up a key combination that will provide 
 quick access without using the shortcut. Right click on the shortcut and 
 select Properties.  In the Shortcut key window, select any key you can 
 remember and click OK.  Ctrl+Alt and that key will open the application 
 whenever needed.
 
 10.  DON'T BELIEVE YOUR EMAIL.  We've been asked about those emails with 
 virus attachments that appear to be coming from NNT, asking for a 
 confirmation of a subscription.  Don't believe it, and don't open the 
 attachments.  Maybe this exchange between NNT and Lyris (our mail manager) 
 will clear things up:
 
 NNT: Is there anything that can be done about the current strains of virus 
 that implant on address books and randomly send email asking alleged 
 subscribers to verify their subscription (when they haven't subscribed at 
 all)? I've received some of these as well, and I know it's become a 
 widespread problem with other ezine publishers, creating a lot of ill will 
 all around.  Is there some configuration that we could change to keep 
 these from going out except to legitimate subscribers?
 
 Lyris:  Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do about this since it 
 isn't actually ListManager doing the sending.  The real problem is that 
 people sometimes will add the ""join"" address to their address book and 
 that is what causes the problems.  The best we can do is advise people not 
 to have their address books set to automatically add any email address 
 that they send a message to even once.  The main culprit here seems to be 
 Outlook Express.

 It's not so much an alternative as it is a small

 these matters, we're like brothers who think our

864,"Subject: [SAtalk] Protect individual MS-Exchange mailboxes
","I rigged this up for testing before I commit to a sitewide rollout of
 Spamassassin as an SMTP relay.
 It is more work, but it avoids sitewide changes in mail delivery during the
 early stages of testing.
 
 On the Exchange server... (mail.yourdomain.com)
 Create a new, private SMTP address (nomorespam@yourdomain.com) for the
 mailbox you want to protect. Remove the old address.
 
 Create a ""custom recipient"" with the old SMTP address
 (spammedalot@yourdomain.com). Create another custom recipient pointing at a
 local user on the Spamassassin box (killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com).
 
 Set the first custom recipient to forward all mail to the second custom
 recipient. (must forward to another address in the Exchange directory)
 
 On the Spamassassin box... (filtermail.yourdomain.com)
 Set up a dummy user, in this case ""killspam""
 Give killspam a .forward file pointing to the final recipient's new, private
 smtp address back on the Exchange server.
 
 So the message flow is like this:
 
 Mail arrives on the Exchange server mail.yourdomain.com for
 spammedalot@yourdomain.com
 
 spammedalot@commonwealth.com forwards it to
 killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com
 
 Following the .forward file, the e-mail is then forwarded to
 nomorespam@yourdomain.com
 
 
 Wowie Zowie it works. The first address I protected was myself, the second
 one I protected was postmaster.
 
 As you can see, you must create two custom recipients in Exchange and one
 dummy account with a .forward file on the spam filter box for each address
 you want to protect. Like I said, it is more work, but until I am done
 load-testing, this is the way it will stay.

 I havent used the FBSD poll, as it's not portable, select and poll(still not
 100%) are all that exist in the UNIX world. Redhat of course doesnt count as
 portable either, but it's nice they are trying. The Windows I/O model does
 definately blow the doors off the UNIX one, but then they had select to
 point at in it's suckiness and anything would have been an improvement. UNIX
 is just now looking at it's I/O model and adapting to a multiprocess
 multithreaded world so it's gonna be years yet before a posix API comes out
 of it. Bottom line is the ""do stuff when something happens"" model turned out
 to be right, and the UNIX ""look for something to do and keep looking till
 you find it no matter how many times you have to look"" is not really working
 so great anymore.

 Have done exactly this with debian, only I used a PCMCIA network card and
 did it off ftp.esat.net (ucd bandwidth is rather good).
 
 However, if you've another machine, look into this null modem cable jobby:
 
 http://rosebud.sps.queensu.ca/~edd/t100cs.html
 
 whether you can connect that to direct cable connectionI've no idea.  You
 could however, put the files onto windows, boot onto a ILUG BBC[tm] and
 mount the fat32 partition.
 
 Easier/Quicker way is to get your hands on a PCMCIA nic.  Also makes the
 maptop far more useful in the long run.

 Well, shiver me timbers, but my favorite pirate phrase is missing from 
 both of those.Arrr....
 and wondering if there's a rap equivalent.
 Owen
 
 http://www.quinion.com/words/qa/qa-shi2.htm
 *Q AND A SECTION*
 
 *SHIVER MY TIMBERS*
 
 /From Tad Spencer/: ""Please could you tell me where the phrase /shiver 
 my timbers/ originated?""
 
 This is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be 
 better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any 
 actual sailors' usage.
 
 It's an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or 
 other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver, or shake, so implying a 
 calamity has occurred. It is first recorded as being used by Captain 
 Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: ""I won't thrash you Tom. 
 Shiver my timbers if I do"".
 
 It has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years 
 later Robert Louis Stevenson found it to be just the kind of old-salt 
 saying that fitted the character of Long John Silver in /Treasure 
 Island/: ""Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before 
 you ... some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, 
 and all to feed the fishes"". Since then, it's mainly been the preserve 
 of second-rate seafaring yarns.

 I can tell you what the 'clear' and 'del' arguments mean:
 
 Mh_SequenceUpdate lists/l-k clear cur {} public
 	This means to clear the 'cur' sequence for lists/l-k
 
 Mh_SequenceUpdate lists/l-k del unseen 5400 public
 	This means to delete message 5400 from the 'unseen' sequence for lists/l-k
 
 Can you explain more what you were actually doing as this occurred?  This 
 doesn't appear to be background processing.  Is there significance to message 
 5400?  Is it the one that isn't displaying?

 Good points all but they don't apply in this case.  Someone is speaking and
 a group of selfish bastards only interested in getting their rocks off are
 trying to shout him down (they are doing it because 'it's good for the
 soul'. Kind like Chuckie Manson doing the stuff he did cause 'it was good
 for his soul'). Unprincipled and evil. It's got nothing to do with throwing
 tea in the harbor or the DoI.

 Research Alert - Undervalued
 August 26, 2002
 XrayMedia
 (OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8
 
 Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! 
 
 Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news.
 
 Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... 
 
 Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!
 
 How does the company do this? 
 
 XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a ""mass source to advertising sector "" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companys strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. 
 
 Their ""source to business model"", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.
 
 While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.
 
  *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.
 
 *** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. 
 
 *** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.
 
 *** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.
 
 *** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. 
 
 *** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings ""substantially"" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.

878,"Subject: Ringing bell on other computer
","
 Hi,
 
 succeeded in ringing a bell anytime I get a mail
 to my inbox (Not Mailing lists, spams etc.) by
 using procmail to execute a ""play clink.wav"" on
 the ""right"" mails.
 Now my demands are growing ;-)
 I use my laptop remotely very often and now I would
 like the bell to sound on that when I am there.
 I triedto use the KDE remote sound server and it works in
 the tests, but when procmail runs it it doesn't, presumably
 as it doesn't have the authorization to communicate with
 the laptop, beeing another user?
 
 Any hints.

   Answer to the question from the last newsletter:
   <p>
   Plug your Pocket PC into the USB port on the new TiVo
   Series2, and you can transfer recording onto the handheld to
   watch while you're on the go.
   <p>
   No, this one's false. First of all, none of the proposed
   ""home-entertainment features"" for the Series2 DVRs have been rolled
   out yet. And so far, neither TiVo nor its partners have
   proposed such a feature.

","Hi Marc,
 
 There have been several changes in the trust system recently. We'll start
 seeing confidence values published with signatures from tomorrow morning
 (around 4AM). This should be resolved then. Please revoke anything you
 don't consider spam. It reduces the trust of the person who reported it as
 well as the confidence of the signature.
 
 cheers,
 vipul.

 > Document: HP backs off DMCA threat
 > 
 > By CNET News.com Staff
 > August 1, 2002, 6:10 PM PT
 > 
 > Hewlett-Packard Thursday abandoned legal threats it made against security 
 > analysts who publicized flaws in the company's software.
 > 
 > In a statement released late Thursday, HP said it would not use the Digital 
 > Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a controversial copyright law, to pursue a 
 > loosely-organized team of researchers who demonstrated a bug in the company's 
 > Tru64 Unix operating system.
 > 
 > The following is the company's statement:
 > 
 > 1) HP is committed to protecting our customer's security environments.
 > 
 > 2) We have verified that there is a security vulnerability with Tru64 UNIX, the 
 > details of which were brought to our attention July 18. The problem has now been 
 > isolated and HP has been preparing a fix, which will be available within the 
 > next 48 hours.
 > 
 > 3) We won't comment on the specifics of our discussions with SnoSoft. However, 
 > we take our customers' security requirements very seriously and have a strong 
 > track record following industry-standard security practices.
 > 
 > 4) Where and how the DMCA should be applied is a matter of great controversy. 
 > The reported letter to SnoSoft was not consistent or indicative of HP's policy. 
 > We can say emphatically that HP will not use the DMCA to stifle research or 
 > impede the flow of information that would benefit our customers and improve 
 > their system security.

 LESSON 2: COMPANIES GONE WRONG
 
 Instructors: Bill Mann, TMF Otter (with Matt Richey, TMF Matt)
 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690055
 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690056
 
 In Lesson 1, we offered a list of red flags that trigger instant
 sales. These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with
 current events surrounding the companies you hold.
 
 Notice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing
 Wall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one
 reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly
 don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems.
 
 Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have
 significantly more access to business management than we ever
 will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable
 insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of
 company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond
 market (more on this later). ""Strong buy?"" Pfffffft.
 
 In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is
 slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly
 valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large
 share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple
 of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is
 priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple
 company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business
 starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows,
 whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular,
 it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a
 company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals.
 
 So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to
 go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning
 signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens.
 
 WARNING SIGN 1: SLOWING SALES GROWTH
 Through 2000, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of
 the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best
 capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the
 market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted
 revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April
 2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the
 next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E)
 company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in
 a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a
 barnburner like Nokia, one is enough.
 
 Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest
 sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they
 always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then
 canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If
 you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and
 they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell
 trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give
 a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on
 the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a
 year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a
 year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly
 growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew
 sequential growth.)
 
 WARNING SIGN 2: DIVERGENT SALES AND PROFIT GROWTH
 By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs
 were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies
 growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom
 lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales
 were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end
 of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70%
 to 40%.
 
 Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to
 collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics
 changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock
 reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the
 technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see
 signs that something was wrong.
 
 WARNING SIGN 3: PLUMMETING CASH FLOWS
 In 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings
 perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look
 at two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free
 cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have
 significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash
 flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999,
 Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion,
 based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the
 world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications
 equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion.
 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690057
 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690058
 
 But as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were
 afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an
 operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost
 $276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in
 reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than
 $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference
 between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating
 cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3
 billion, and not in a good way.
 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690059
 
 The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have
 saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999,
 Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but
 twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow
 is reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.)
 
 And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on
 Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they
 weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it.
 
 WARNING SIGN 4: WATCH THOSE BONDS
 Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's
 because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's
 almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best
 interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the
 same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds.
 
 Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally
 paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the
 current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds
 bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I
 recommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of
 the bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders
 are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same

 I recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company
 and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity
 between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced
 at 100 is at ""par,"" which means that the bond's face-value
 interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some
 bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be
 lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk.
 But some are priced below face value, even way below.
 http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690062
 
 As of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at
 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance
 they'll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent
 problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with
 2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not
 one that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports
 a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than
 Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they
 don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either.
 
 WARNING SIGN 5: ""IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER""
 For a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the
 largest company in the world by market capitalization. This
 should have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the
 stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion
 implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach
 $34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings
 higher than $12 billion in a single year.
 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690063
 
 As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco --
 it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that
 article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any
 better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no
 signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000,
 Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8
 billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of
 53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then
 66% higher.
 
 Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine
 a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for
 future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the
 midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As
 investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities.
 Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this
 point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business
 was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot
 has to be right for the situation to work out.
 
 HOMEWORK
 For this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after
 Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you
 looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company,
 do the following:
 
 - Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four
   quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating,
   staying about the same, or weakening?
 
 - Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past
   four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing
   slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures?
 
 - Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past
   three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net
   income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look
   at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around
   due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much
   more indicative of real cash flow trends.)
 
 - If your company has long-term debt, go the Yahoo! Bond Center
   and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know
   whether your company has any debt, just type your company name
   into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)
   http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690064
 
 - Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its
   current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is
   there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario
   already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market,
   this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's
   still a question you should consider.)

 Bill Mann, TMF Otter</a> (with <a href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690013"">Matt Richey, TMF Matt</a>)
 
 <br /><br />
 <P>In Lesson 1, we offered a list of red flags that trigger instant sales. These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with current events surrounding the companies you hold.
 <BR><BR>Notice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing Wall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have significantly more access to business management than we ever will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond market (more on this later). ""Strong buy?"" Pfffffft.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows, whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular, it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens.</P>
 <P><STRONG><STRONG></STRONG></STRONG></P>
 <P><STRONG>Warning sign 1: Slowing sales growth <BR></STRONG>Through 2000, <STRONG>Nokia</STRONG> (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April 2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E) company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a barnburner like Nokia, one is enough.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew sequential growth.)</P>
 <P></P>
 <P><STRONG>Warning sign 2: Divergent sales and profit growth <BR></STRONG>By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70% to 40%.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see signs that something was wrong. <EM><EM></EM></EM></P>
 <P></P>
 <P><STRONG>Warning sign 3: Plummeting cash flows<BR></STRONG>In 1999, <STRONG>Lucent</STRONG> (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look at two numbers: <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690014"">operating cash flow</A> and <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690015"">free cash flow</A>. Free cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999, Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion, based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>But as Matt and I <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690016"">detailed in January 2000</A>, big troubles were afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company <EM>lost</EM> $276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3 billion, and not in a good way.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999, Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow is reported as a loss of <EM>$1.8 billion</EM>.)</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P><STRONG>Warning sign 4: Watch those bonds</STRONG> <BR>Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I recommend keeping a <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690017"">log sheet</A> where you write down the price of the bond. <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690018"">Download it here</A>. If you see a drop, the bondholders are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same time analysts are shouting, ""Strong buy!""</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>I recommend the <A href=""http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690019"">Yahoo! Bond Center</A>. You can search on any company and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced at 100 is at ""par,"" which means that the bond's face-value interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk. But some are priced below face value, even <EM>way</EM> below.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>As of this writing, <STRONG>WorldCom</STRONG> (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance they'll be paid. <STRONG>Tyco</STRONG> (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with 2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not one that alludes to an imminent default. <STRONG>Qwest</STRONG> (NYSE: Q) sports a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P><STRONG>Warning sign 5: ""It just doesn't get any better""</STRONG> <BR>For a brief time in 2000, <STRONG>Cisco Systems</STRONG> (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the largest company in the world by market capitalization. This should have been a warning. <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690020"">As I wrote</A> in May 2000 when the stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach $34 billion in 2010.

 KEVIN GEORGE
 
 ABIDJAN,COTE D'IVORIE
 WEST AFRICA
 
 Dearest one,
 
 Although we have not met, I got your contact through the internet and  decided to contact you for assistance. I was, until recently, a final  year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone,West Africa.  Early in January last year, the rebels
 in my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father, King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target.
 
 Fortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took  place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father,when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document, I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving next
 of kin to my father.
 
 But deliberatley, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it  to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a
 time that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helping
 me to solve this my problem. Most importantly,Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing.
 Please you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684
 I remain yours sincerely,
 
 KEVIN GEORGE

 My typical Java-to-C conversion doesn't increase the lines of code by
 more than 20%, and a fair portion of that is the implementation of
 additional features that drove us to do the conversion in the first
 place.  Some things are substantially more succinct when written in C
 than in Java.  C and most other mature languages have an endless
 collection of libraries.  I personally don't use anything beyond the
 core libraries of any language that much though.
 
 On a tangent, I find libraries nearly useless for a great many things
 due primarily to the fact that most of them are so general that a given
 non-trivial API almost always has a context in which it will function in
 a pathological manner.  Code reuse is wonderful and all that, but
 libraries frequently make design trade-offs that won't work for me even
 if they theoretically do exactly what I need.  Unfortunately, it isn't
 particularly easy nor does it make a nice simple API to design a library
 that really is optimizable to a wide range of design cases.  I've built
 a small collection of flexible psuedo-polymorphic APIs over the years
 that I tend to use, but it is a pretty ugly solution for code reuse when
 you get right down to it.

 They were the ruling class of a feudal, farming society for quite some
 time; I believe there were more than a few issues there. Certainly, not
 everyone in Tibet is as excited about the Dalai Lama as Hollywood
 appears to be. [Not that the Chinese are much better rights-wise, but
 they've actually built roads and such, which led to the creation of
 merchant classes and the like that never existed under the Tibetans.]

 Actually, I take that back.  You're not running the latest ftoc.tcl either.
 
 It probably is my bug, but it's in code that's been changed since you last 
 updated from CVS (Saturday), so please update and let's see if the problem is 
 still there.

 Hmm.. I've seen the *opposite* issue - if I go to *SEND* a signed message,
 sometimes Exmh will put up the dialog box, but fail to set keyboard focus
 there, so no passphrase can be entered.  Of course, hitting 'return' doesnt
 work so you need to click the 'OK' box, at which point it finds that the
 passphrase that wasn't entered doesn't work, and asks again, this time with
 proper focus set.
 
 I suspect some variable/codepath is getting hosed for the focus, or possibly
 some borkedness with --no-tty and/or --status-fd flags to gnupg.

 No.  They.  Are.  Not.
 
 Those lines are technically *advertising*.

 This I would guess is normal, but don't you get it at the very beginning of

 Argh, I forgot to exclude aaxine from the %files when using ""--without

 The current ""fr6.1"" spec file fixes this...

 I'm reading this now as that you trained on about 220 spam and about 220
 ham.  That's less than 10% of the sizes of the training sets I've been
 using.  Please try an experiment:  train on 550 of each, and test once
 against the other 550 of each.  Do that a few times making a random split
 each time (it won't be long until you discover why directories of individual
 files are a lot easier to work -- e.g., random.shuffle() makes this kind of
 thing trivial for me).

 i'm a very happy user of exmh, but i'm paranoid also :-)
 therefore i'm not too happy with exmh caching my pgp passphrases.
 
 usually i use a relatively secure tool called 'quintuple agent' 
 <URL:http://www.vibe.at/tools/secret-agent/> to store my passphrases,
 and i've just added the few lines of code to exmh which allow for such
 external caches.
 
 the patch is attached, it is against version 2.5-1 (debian), and the
 files modified are extrasInit.tcl and pgpExec.tcl.
 
 i've added three new preferences in the 'general pgp' section, which
 allow everybody to use his/her favourite external tool to get the
 passphrase (everything which spits out the phrase on stdout is ok).
 
 i'd be happy if somebody with cvs access thinks that this stuff 
 is worth to be added and does so; apart from that i'm happy for 
 suggestions, comments or critique (mind you, i'm not exactly a special 
 friend of tcl so my code may leave things to be desired...)

912,"Subject: EBusiness Webforms: cluetrain has left the station
","What's wrong with doing business over the Web?  Web forms.  There's
 promising replacements forms, but this is the current state of the
 industry:
 
  o You find something that you want to fill out.  It's a partnership form,
    a signup for a Web seminar, a request for more information, anything.
  o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend
    about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops
    just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback
    when halfway through, you start to wonder if it's really worth your
    time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list. 
  o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized.
    I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world
    listed; the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you
    to hit submit, but due to the layout, the ""more>"" tag on the second
    row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except
    about two dozen third world countries. 
  o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all forms based things complain
    about using the universal country phone number format and will cause
    you to re-enter dashes instead of dots.
  o When you get something that's not entered right, you will go back and
    enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will
    automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to
    go back and resent that freaking thing too.  Finally after all combinations
    of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit.
  o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation.  
  o Sometimes, like today, you won't be able to ever submit anything due
    to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that
    is internally non-conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their
    forms submission.
 
 What's wrong with this picture?  The company is screwing you by wasting
 your time enforcing their data collection standards on you.  I'm sure there's
 someone in that company that would be willing to accept ""US"", ""U.S"", ""USA""
 ""United States"", ""U of A"", ""America"", etc. and would know exactly which
 freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them
 to waste even more time playing Web form geography.  
 
 I'm starting to see the light of Passport.  You want more information?  Hit
 this passport button.  Voila.  IE6 and Netscape 6,7 have pre-forms sutff,
 but I always turn it off because you never know when there's that one field
 that you don't want to submit to the person you are submitting to that 
 automatically gets sent, i.e. the privacy stuff is well beyond the 
 average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff.  
 
 So, if crappy forms-based submission is the state of practice for
 business enablement on the Web, I can't see this whole data submission
 and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process as
 working all that well.

 I thought this nekkid URL was going to be about the
 infringement of 1st amendment rights for broadcasters
 and proposed campaign finanice restrictions preventing them
 from making money on advertisements that are deemed
 thinly veiled campaign contributions by some arbitrary
 government board.  As it was posted to ""discussion"" I
 thought there'd be some.
 
 Instead it's a Post-Gazette column by Brian O'Neill
 lamenting the fact that some people know how to
 fill out a permit so that they can take advantage
 of their right to peaceable assembly.  Obviously
 he's poking fun at the idea that specific groups
 get specific ""zones"" and that it's not up to the
 police to decide what messages and signs get put into
 what zones to most expediently keep order.  
 
 The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied
 nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting
 political rallies that you don't agree with has become
 common practice.  The courts have constantly ruled
 that there are some restrictions on the first amendment.
 They teach you that your very first year of law school.
 
 I think that given the information as laid out by the story,
 Mr. O'Neill has confused free speech with action.  Free
 speech or even protected speech as practiced by almost 
 every American seems to involve the ability to communicate
 an idea to an unknown audience.  Action involves directing
 a specific comment to a specific well-defined individual or audience
 that has immediate, harmful, and sometimes physical 
 effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person. 
 
 I think Bill Neel of Butler needs to go back to school
 as obviously he must have been sleeping in his civics

 The history of crime and punishment illustrates the need for /both/,

 FAMILY=3D""SANSSERIF"" FACE=3D""Arial"" LANG=3D""0"">.</B> Some choose to =
 operateout of<BR>
 their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable<BR>
 organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business<BR>
 offices.<BR>
 <BR>
 Today our company and our associates have over 126<BR>
 million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently<BR>
 processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form<BR>
 of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.<BR>
 Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break<BR>
 even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on<BR>
 the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting<BR>
 capability is so extensive that government agencies, police<BR>
 officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us<BR>
 for reports.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Many of our associates already have real estate liens in<BR>
 force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.<BR>
 Legally this means that when the properties are sold or<BR>
 refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%<BR>
 interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.<BR>
 Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to<BR>
 $500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the<BR>
 payment of the principal.<BR>
 <BR>
 Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per<BR>
 year. This is just for interest, not counting principle<BR>
 and not counting the compounding of the interest which can<BR>
 add substantial additional income. Typically companies are<BR>
 sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest<BR>
 an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell<BR>
 their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.<BR>
 <BR>
 92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%<BR>
 are women and 36% are part time .<BR>
 <BR>
 One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are<BR>
 not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off<BR>
 for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are<BR>
 working on will be there when you return. The Judgments<BR>
 are still in force, they do not disappear.<BR>
 <BR>
 The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your<BR>
 computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You<BR>
 never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you<BR>
 are. You are not a collection agency.<BR>
 <BR>
 Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing<BR>
 are as follows:<BR>
 <BR>
 Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals<BR>
 with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who<BR>
 to write to)<BR>
 <BR>
 8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you<BR>
 and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them<BR>
 unless you want to.<BR>
 <BR>
 You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to<BR>
 sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and<BR>
 50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for<BR>
 $2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.<BR>
 <BR>
 You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor<BR>
 and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to<BR>
 assist you. They range from credit reports from all three<BR>
 credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment<BR>
 locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>
 The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to<BR>
 1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge<BR>
 $6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other<BR>
 companies charge $25.00.<BR>
 <BR>
 Once you find the debtor and their assets you file<BR>
 garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.<BR>
 (Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the<BR>
 course)<BR>
 <BR>
 When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to<BR>
 the original Judgment holder.<BR>
 <BR>
 Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of<BR>
 Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)<BR>

 ""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately<BR>
 $500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I<BR>
 will have to hire someone to help out""<BR>
 <BR>
 Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only<BR>
 charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I<BR>
 have added 3 full time people to help me after only having<BR>
 your course for 5 months""<BR>
 <BR>
 >From the above information and actual results you can see<BR>
 why we can state the following:<BR>
 <BR>
 With our course you can own your own successful business.<BR>
 A business which earns you substantial income now and one<BR>
 which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to<BR>
 retire on and travel the world. A business which is<BR>
 extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every<BR>
 day is new and exciting.<BR>
 <BR>
 None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is<BR>
 Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate<BR>
 Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from<BR>
 your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full<BR>
 time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from<BR>
 others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you<BR>
 control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen<BR>
 for many others already. Make it happen for you!<BR>
 <BR>
 If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you<BR>
 to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation<BR>
 on your part.<BR>

 Include a random token with an expiration date with anything you send.  
 Valid whitelisting of From:you@here.net yet invalid random token would get 
 blocked.

 Spammers cannot be bothered to keep track if individual whitelists 
 associated with a given email address.

 Of course you populate your whitelist with contents of your inbox minus 
 spam, and then add manually stuff from your addressbook.

 What's the point of multiple email addresses? They're a pain.

","URL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000611
 Date: 2002-09-23T23:21:12-06:00
 
 Finally finished up (most of) TRAMP, my RDF interface for Python. (If you don't 
 use RDF or Python you can probably safely skip this entry.)  
 
 New in this version: RDF library abstraction (because rdflib's organization 
 currently sucks), write values in addition to reading, and unit tests, all with 
 that old TRAMP flavor you've come to know and love.  
 
 _But wait,_ it also comes with an entire page of explanation/advertisement[1] 
 if you're not already convinced.
 
 
 
     RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal 
     with data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same 
     time? Need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? *
     TRAMP may or may not be the answer to these problems!*
 
 
 
 Enjoy, and get a free bonus prize if you can tell me[2] why it's called TRAMP.

928,"Subject: [ILUG] Cobalt question
"," Try this little problem on for size:
 
  I've installed Redhat 7.3 on a raq3's disk. But fscked if I can get the
 kernel in /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-3 to boot. It's insisting pulling the
 kernel from ... somewhere else. The old cobalt kernel.
 
  I've booted the disk with a redhat rescue CD, and installed grub on the
 MBR and hda1 & hda2 (just in case). No luck. The cobalt BIOS says ""Booting
 default method - From disk"".
 
  Any ideas how I can get this thing to boot *my* kernel ? Anyone care to
 guess how the cobalt boot process ? Google seems very quiet on the
 subject of the cobalt boot process, and what is there doesn't seem to
 work. Simple stuff like:
 
  (how to boot a different kernel)
  http://list.cobalt.com/pipermail/cobalt-developers/1999-December/022014.html
 
  And, on boot:
 
 Cobalt:Main Menu> bfd /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-3
 First stage kernel: Decompressing - done
 Second stage kernel: Decompressing - done
 Linux version 2.2.16C28 (konkers@unicron.cobalt.com)
 
  Note the descrepancy between what I want to boot, and actually booted.

930,"Subject: [ILUG] Create a PAYCHECK with your COMPUTER and Enjoy Cheap ISP & shopping Discount.
","Hi -
 
 ( http://club.4tfox.com )
 
 You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
 Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
 And they expect you to listen to them?
 
 Enough.
 
 If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
 hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
 a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
 show YOU how to do the same thing.
 
 This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
 can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
 an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.
 
 How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
 We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
 But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
 insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
 and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
 you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
 just the thing you are looking for.
 
 This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
 done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
 there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
 meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
 each month also).
 
 Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
 free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
 decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
 have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
 them incredibly well, if they work at it.
 
 To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
  web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
  information
 
 ""Send me a free membership!""
 
 Be sure to include your:
 1. First name
 2. Last name
 3. Email address (if different from above)
 
 We will confirm your position and send you a special report
 as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.
 
 If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)
 you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,
 Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,
 
 You can also go to the web address:
 http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService
 
 That's all there's to it.
 
 We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.
 
 Looking forward to hearing from you!
 
 Sincerely, 
 
 Hugh Zou
 
 P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
 marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
 This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
 REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
 and finally make real money on the internet.
 
 Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
 program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
 membership.

933,"Subject: We're trying to decide if FogBUGZ 3.0 should support custom
","URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020912.html
 Date: Not supplied
 
 We're trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields. 
 Historically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get 
 abused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything 
 they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. 
 End result: people don't enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not 
 capturing all that information. You can always ""page fault"" to get the 
 information if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in 
 every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine 
 (this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be 
 relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the 
 programmer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be 
 dll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking 
 for the DLL info? Similarly, it's always tempting to add a field in which you 
 ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but 
 trust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing 
 only: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first 
 place. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can 
 always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be 
 relevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on 
 Windows 98SE? Aha! You can't. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not 
 every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so 
 this search doesn't make sense in the first place. The info wasn't captured. Do 
 a full text search for 98SE and you'll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) 
 
 Life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of 
 information -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on 
 the computer in question and while you're at it, a photograph of the tester's 
 workspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_, 
 which, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I 
 have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking 
 package was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the 
 system, because they didn't know what all those fields were. The _real_ 
 bug-""tracking"" happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great. 
 
 A pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, ""does 
 FogBUGZ support custom fields?"" Rather than giving our usual answer (""no. on 
 purpose."") over the last few weeks I've been saying, ""can you please tell me 
 what fields you would need? We're trying to decide whether to implement that 
 feature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it."" The interesting thing 
 is, almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ,_ and the 
 other ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn't be fields. And in fact, our 
 existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our 
 biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted 
 to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, 
 but I didn't, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track 
 of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are 
 happy and keep buying more site licenses. 
 
 But the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking 
 software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in 
 our product. ""Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields."" Righto. It's true. And 
 who am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to 
 yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a 
 built-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and 
 inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But 
 it's still rude of me to tell customers that we don't have that feature _for 
 their own good_, even though it usually is, and we're losing some sales because 
 of it. 
 
 Sigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so 
 hard to use that people don't use it. At least we won't lose any sales :)

 <font size=3><b>Battered stocks regain ground</b></font><br>
 Led by a surge in chip titan Intel, beaten-down technology shares rose Thursday.
 <p>
 Despite a Merrill Lynch downgrade of Yahoo to ""reduce/sell"", the Internet portal rose after posting better-than-expected second-quarter results and also helped lift the sector. CNET's Tech index gained 29.87 points, or 3.11 percent, to close at 995.16. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index tacked on 28.42 points, or 2.11 percent, to close at 1,374.43--after hitting a five-year low Wednesday.
 <p>
 Broader markets were mixed amid news wholesale prices rose slightly and drug firm Bristol-Myers Squibb is being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.0 points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 8,801.5. The S&P 500 added 6.9 points, or 0.75 percent, to close at 927.37, after it too reached a five-year low Wednesday.

 Hewlett-Packard is trying to beat the heat with summer deals on PCs.
 For retail buyers in the United States, the company is offering several new rebate or promotional programs, designed to stimulate demand for its PCs, going into the back-to-school shopping season. Some of the deals include a new $200 mail-in rebate on desktops, while others offer instant $50 rebates.<br><B>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 15.23 -0.13% </B>

 The PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal.
 The lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday.<br><B>EBAY INC 60.38 2.63% </B>

 Europe's biggest software maker, SAP AG, shocked the market on Thursday by unexpectedly cutting its sales forecast and missing analysts' forecast for the second quarter.
 
 The company said it would post a net loss of 235 million euros ($232 million) and said it was taking a non-recurring accounting charge of 414 million euros to cover impairments of minority investments in the United States, including a 318 million euros charge from its 20 percent stake in Commerce One.<br><B>SAP AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT ADS 19.70 -7.73% </B>

 Analysts Justin Baldauf and Tim Gernitis cut their intermediate-term rating on the Internet giant from ""neutral"" to ""reduce/sell"" and their long-term rating from ""strong buy"" to ""neutral"" after seeing Yahoo's second-quarter results. Although the results look solid at first, Baldauf and Gernitis say Yahoo's growth was driven entirely by new initiatives. They also argue the firm's improved outlook seems driven completely by the Overture deal extension. Eventually, these initiatives will result in much lower growth rates, the analysts say. They argue Yahoo's stock price isn't supported by the firm's fundamentals.<br><B>YAHOO INC 12.92 5.99% </B><br>

 I'm now twice a published author. Earlier in the week, I released my  
 <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/cat_macintosh.html"">top 50 Mac OS X tips</a>, 
 which marks the only thing I've ever written that I 
 expect anyone to pay for. If you happen to use OS X, go check them out. 
 My second publication is a PDF only explanation of the process for 
 converting Vinyl LPs to CD, by way of your PC (how's that for alphabet 
 soup). For the time being, you can get it absolutely free, with the 
 caveat that I'd appreciate some feed back on what could be added to make 
 it more useful (I'm considering some screen shots for it if I get some 
 time). What are you waiting for -- 
 <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/cat_audio.html"">get something free already</a>.

 With the expiration of Lockergnome's old cell phone plan, Lori and I 
 opted to make a switch to Verizon, at the recommendation of Brian 
 Stevens. I'm already happy with the suggestion, as our previous provider 
 had horrid customer service, not to mention I now have a much geekier 
 phone in the form of the 
 <a href=""http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/kysmart/kysmart_series.htm"">Kyocera QCP 6035</a> 
 Palm powered unit. It's just 
 larger than most Palm devices on the market, but having the device 
 integration is nice. It has all the functionality of a Palm, with some 
 Internet browsing capabilities and of course, phone access. A built in 
 speakerphone actually works better than I expected,  Now all I need to 
 do is get more applications installed.
 <p>
 Of interest to anyone who signed up for 
 <a href=""http://mp3.lockergnome.com"">emusic</a> after Chris and I talked 
 the service up and down last week: It seems they've added in the ballpark 
 of 1,000 Universal titles to their roster of offerings. Not surprising 
 considering they're part of the same conglomerate, but still good news 
 in terms of feature expansion.

 The majority of GIF animation on the Web does absolutely nothing for 
 me. I'm of the mindset that animation is meant to either tell a story 
 or illustrate a concept -- not put something in motion just because 
 you can. That said, for anyone wanting to create animations, this tool 
 makes it nice and easy. A storyboard interface keeps you thinking like 
 a movie maker as you build your animated creations, which lends itself 
 to helping anyone who'd like to get from point A to point B in an 
 orderly fashion. The software supports PSD, JPG, AVI, BMP, and GIF 
 formats, leaving your options open for creating animated segments.

 <b>Madshrimps Extreme CDROM Testing</b><p>

 A little on the childish side, but this CD-Rom drive test is still very funny. 
 Watch as this group rewrites the rules on drive benchmarking. If geek TV were 
 more like this, even non-geeks would tune in to watch (which probably says 
 more than it should about the lowest common denominator). A WMV capable player 
 is required,.

 Two out of work rent-a-cops make an attempt to break into the music 
 video industry in this quirky comedy. John Cusack and Tim Robbins 
 make this comedy work, starring as the two security guards as they 
 send up all sorts of Hollywood stereotypes. You can't help but laugh 
 at the ridiculous predicaments these two survive, as they are 
 greeted with cameos by a who's who of music and movie industry names. 
 I'm sure neither Robbins nor Cusack would openly list this movie on a 
 resume, but it is indeed a brilliant performance by both of them, 
 especially as a demonstration of their ability to play off of each 
 other. Although this is a late 80's release (one of the few 80's 
 underground classics I hadn't previously seen), it remains relevant 
 to those out there who are looking to put it to the man. If you've 
 ever hated the recording industry and its in-crowd attitude, you'll 
 love this film. A closing reference to Rene's Courtyard Cafe in Santa 
 Monica, which is a regular stop for me every time I'm in the LA area, 
 prompted me to want to watch the film for a second viewing. The movie 
 is humorous enough for several viewings. Nothing really grabs attention 
 on the DVD, but then again, the studio probably expects no one will buy 
 it anyway.

 I have a working apt 0.5.4cnc7 package for Red Hat Linux 8.0. It will be
 available at the same second the distribution will, and so will a complete
 apt repository already including quite a few of my packages updated for Red
 Hat Linux 8.0.
 
 I didn't want to say all this before Monday, but as the new release already
 leaked from many places, and official statements made about it, it
 shouldn't be a big deal :-/
 
 I'll keep you all posted on Monday! They'll even be a big apt-related
 surprise! ;-))))

 I'll just take the free one, OK?
 
 No?
 
 Oh, so actually it's not free at all; you're just bundling, with a unit

 Subject:	[SAtalk] user_perfs
 
 
 I am having troubles setting up the User_Perfs file and I know it is reading them, 
 cause if I change the score value it works based on the changes.  My questions has 
 to do with allowing certain domains not to be scanned for spam for a certain mbox.  I 
 can not get to the spamassassin.org site to check.
 
 Question:
 
 Is this the correct way to code it?
 
 # Whitelist and blacklist addresses are now file-glob-style patterns, so
 # ""friend@somewhere.com"", ""*@isp.com"", or ""*.domain.net"" will all work.
 whitelist_from  *@freelotto.com
 whitelist_from  *@luckysurf.com
 
 Thanks!!

","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85490092
 Date: Not supplied
 
 Brian sez: Vocera Communications has developed what is essentially a Star Trek: 
 TNG-style lapel communicator device that uses WiFi to transmit voice across 
 networks. 
 
     The Vocera Communications System consists of Vocera Server Software, 
     residing on a customer premise server, and Vocera Communications Badges, 
     which operate over a wireless LAN (802.11b). The badge - which weighs less 
     than 2 ounces - includes a microphone and speaker, LCD readout to display 
     text messages, and an 802.11b wireless radio. It can be clipped to a shirt 
     pocket or collar, or worn on a lanyard.

 Perhaps a feature can be added to razor-report, so that it checks whether a
 message is spam before it submits it.  If it is spam, then don't send the
 body, 4 signatures, etc, just up the ""rating"" for that individual spam.

 Always happy to contribute my mass-check logs.  The only problem is that was

 Dear wireless colleagues:
 
 By the end of 2002, China will have over 200 MLN mobile users. From late
 of 2003, China will issue 3G licenses and full 3G services will be
 available in 2005. Currently, there is still over 5 MLN new mobile users
 coming every month, and the mobile revenue is increasing over 25% every
 year.
 
 China is so far the world's largest wireless market, and the most
 potential business partner in the coming several years. To get involved
 in this huge business, 2002 China Wireless Congress is the best platform
 which focuses on the following issues:
 
 1. The New Business Models of China's Mobile Communications
 2. Infrastructure of Nationwide Wireless Access Systems
 3. Convergence of Wireless Local Access and Mobile Networks
 4. Evolution of 2G networks to 2.5G and 3G networks
 5. Emerging R&D on 4G Mobile and 4G Mobile Forum
 6. Investment Strategies towards 2008 OlympiTek
 7. New Spectrum Management and Sharing Policies
 8. All-Hands Meeting and Marketing Events
 
 In addition, this congress will be together with the famous West-Lake
 Expo'2002, and really a best combination of business and leisure in
 Hangzhou - the most beautiful city of China.

 "" 11 Access Points, Home Gateways and Ethernet bridging
 Most Access Points act as a MAC level bridge, allowing the Wireless LAN to 
 be a natural extension of a wired network. They are deployed in a cellular 
 fashion, and provide extended security, management and roaming.
 On the other hand, the Home Gateways allow a single cell to be connected to 
 a WAN, like a modem, a cable modem or a DSL access. The set of features is 
 quite different, and they offer NAT/masquerading and PPP configuration.
 
 The conventional Ethernet bridging method (promiscuous sniffing) doesn't 
 work with most wireless LAN standard, because of the header encapsulation 
 and the interactions with link layer retransmissions. In other word, most 
 often, when you use a software bridge on a wireless LAN (such as the Linux 
 bridge on a 802.11 card), it doesn't work (moreover, quite often promiscuous 
 is broken as well). ""
 
 [[ What the?? What is he talking about?? Aren't we all using Linux to bridge 
 our networks? ]]
 
 "" The driver could work around this restriction by creating its own MAC 
 headers (802.11 headers instead of 802.3, and putting the right bits in the 
 right place), but in fact most vendors don't provide the specification on 
 how to this with their hardware (when they don't explicitely prevent it in 
 hardware, to force you to buy their Access Points).
 
 In other words, don't expect to use your Linux PC as a wireless bridge or 
 wireless Access Points with most products out there, and forget about 
 turning it into an Access Point. Of course, there is some exceptions. ""
 
 [[ Is this true? ]]
 
 
 "" The workaround is to set the wireless LAN in ad-hoc mode and to use other 
 methods, such as routing, masquerading, IP bridging, ARP proxying... ""
 
 
 [[ Yes, I am in a process of building a wireless-lan <-> wired-lan bridge. 
 But I don't understand what this guy is talking about. Anyone?

 Hi All,
 
 Just wondering if anyone has ever installed StarOffice
 6.0 (or Open Office), and if any have experienced any
 problems with the install freezing ?
 
 I'm using RedHat 7.3 kernel 2.4.18-3, and glibc 2.2.5
 ?
 
 I might try downloading OpenOffice instead if it is
 unresolved!!!!
 
 Cheers all,

","Ok, Iknow this is blatantly OT but I'm beginning to go insane.
 Had an old Dell Dimension XPS sitting in the corner and decided to
 put it to use, I know it was working pre being stuck in the
 corner, but when I plugged it in, hit the power nothing happened.
 I opened her up and had a look and say nothing much. A little orange
 LED comes on when I plug her in but that's it, after some googling
 I found some reference to re-seating all the parts, but no change.
 The problem I'm having is that since the power supply is some Dell
 specific one, ATX block with what looks like one of the old AT
 power connectors, I cant figure out weather this is a Mobo prob
 or a PSU prob. Just to futily try and drag this back OT, I want
 to install Linux on it when I get it working. If anyone knows
 what the problem might be give me a shout.

 A lot of C++ programmers, myself included, were /not/ complaining about 
 gcc's stricter adherence to the specification (which, by the way, a lot 
 of kernel programmers complain about with gcc 3.x -- at least, the 
 patch authors I've talked to hate gcc 3) -- gcc ""2.96"" had a lot of 
 bugs. A lot. It crashed on me many times while working on my projects. 
 Later ""versions"" of ""2.96"" fixed this, but it was well after 3.0 was 
 released that it finally seemed reasonably stable -- and at that point, 
 I just wanted to use 3.0, so I did.

 That shouldn't have been able to happen, but I've just made the code slightly 
 more bullet proof.

 I haven't seen what you describe, but I just saw something close to what you 
 describe.  I think the message that's being incorrectly highlighted as current
 is related to the current message in the other folder rather than being n+1.
 
 I'll have to investigate a bit more to identify and fix the bug, but there is 
 something going on here.

 Wait... I didn't think we had any filters set up on FoRK.
 Kragen, do you know of any?
 
 I personally have FoRK delivered to an address (napier%waste.org)
 that has SpamAssassin enabled, agressively, where it just nukes
 anything it thinks is spam. Usually I figure if I miss a FoRK post,
 no big deal, I'll pick it up by the replies if it's interesting.
 
 For personal mail (joe%barrera.org) I either don't use SpamAssassin,
 or use it but where it just flags messages instead of nuking them.
 So if someone is sending a message just to me, I'll get it even
 if it looks like spam.
 
 So in other words, Rohit, if you had sent to joe%barrera.org, I
 guess I would have received it in a timely fashion.
 
 So where's all that booze? When's the retry?
 Every robust protocol needs a retry strategy --
 what's yours?

     ENRON Corp material assets go on the block 7 AM CT TOMORROW, Wednesday,

     by tons of cool tech. 50 inch plasma panels, desktop LC Displays, boxes of

     individually! Oh yeah, Enron trade-show trinkets too, by the cartload. 
 
     The catch: You have to either go to Texas to pick up the stuff, or arrange

 Mixed news from yesterday's heart checkup. 
 
 First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart 
 was racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive 
 ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head 
 with blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not 
 diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general 
 artery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they 
 were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the 
 heart). 
 
 Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very 
 well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I 
 asked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does 
 it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really 
 not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the 
 ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an 
 angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass 
 because of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part 
 of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?

  Endeavors Technology and RSA Security Form Strategic Partnership to 
  Enhance SSL Performance in Secure, Enterprise-Scalable P2P Computing
 
 Endeavors Technology and RSA Security combine their respective peer-to-peer Magi Enterprise 
 Web collaboration and RSA BSAFE software for SSL users to instantly extend security and improve performance
 of 
 desktop and corporate data sharing, and Web interaction between workgroups inside and across corporations.
 
 Irvine (CA) and Cambridge (UK), September 12, 2002 - Secure web collaboration software leader Endeavors
 Technology, Inc. today
 announced a technology sharing and marketing agreement with RSA Security Inc. the most trusted name in
 e-security. This strategic
 partnership is aimed at extending the security and improving the performance of the standard SSL security
 protocol used by every e-based
 desktop, laptop and server. 
 
 Under the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into Endeavors
 Technology's award-winning Magi
 Enterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and
 encryption to every
 Magi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow
 between workgroups within and
 beyond the enterprise.
 
 Secure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly
 network infrastructures. This
 combination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific
 security tools for each desktop
 application such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration
 can now be rapidly, easily and
 securely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,
 partners and clients without concern
 in compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact
 highly securely with strong
 encryption and authentication across firewalls.
 
 ""In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge,"" says
 Bernard Hulme, chairman and
 CEO of Endeavors Technology. ""Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT
 managers with added
 assurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric
 peer-to-peer computing""
 
 Endeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete
 interoperability between
 partner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurID two-factor authentication, RSA
 ClearTrust Web access
 management, RSA BSAFE encryption and RSA Keon digital certificate management.
 
 The strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging
 and advertising, be listed in
 RSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.
 It will also lead to joint
 marketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on
 joint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide
 business continuity support.
 
 ""Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise
 products and streamlining the
 deployment process for IT managers,"" says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. ""By
 combining our products,
 enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls.""
 
 About Magi
 Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today's Web into a highly secure
 inter- and intra-enterprise
 collaboration network. For the first time, enterprises can implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for
 collaboration very rapidly and
 affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this
 by effectively transforming
 unsecured, ""read-only"" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent collaboration environments, through
 the use of such features as
 cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal name
 spaces generating ""follow me URLs""
 for mobile professionals.

 How is this any different from attaching an Infobot or A.L.I.C.E
 through licq's console-hook?  People have been doing that for years,
 and for over a decade in IRC and the MUDs.
 
 ... and the one thing I think we've learned in all that time is that,
 as a help-desk, it doesn't work.  People just don't like talking to
 robots, especially when the robots, once confused, become imbeciles.
 I think the humans may feel cheated, deceived and tricked when they
 discover, as with the Seattle answer, that they are talking to a
 machine; there's no real intelligence behind that simulated-friendly
 and therefore empty 'thx'.
 
 AIML is clever and cute, but for /practical/ applications as a first
 line of technical support?  It's been tried over and over, and while I
 /also/ think that it /should/ work, for the most part, people won't
 use it.  What's worse, as we make the NL processing more and more
 clever, it only means it fails more dramatically; ALICE doesn't just
 stumble a bit, it starts to drool.  And ALICE is the best we have.
 
 Like a Dalek: All very impressive when things are going well, but all
 it takes to betray the chicken-brain inside is a towel over it's
 ill-placed eye, or a spin off the metal surface ;)
 
 In all the prolog-based NL database query systems of the 1980's and
 other later chatterbot helpdesk projects like Shallow Red, even
 simpler tries like Ask Jeeves, people very quickly know they're
 talking to a robot, and the queries anneal to short, truncated and
 terse database-like verb-noun or just noun-keyword requests.  
 
 People are just too quick to adapt, and too impatient to forgive a
 clunky interface, and for now, especially when the /average/ computer
 user still can't type more than maybe 5-10wpm, NL is a painfully slow
 clunky interface.

 Of course. What we need is an anonymous betting pool on prominent 
 spammer's time of demise. Unfortunately, the government tends to take a 
 dim view of this, for some unfathomable reason.

 Uh, account revokation doesn't have quite the same level of deterrence as 
 cranial indentation with a heavy, blunt object. Honestly, how many people 
 will still spam if they knew they'd be running a real risk of losing life 
 and limb?

988,"Subject: [zzzzteana] Frog Fall at Cheapside
","Near the end of his *Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the
 Madness of Crowds* (1851), Charles Mackay discusses various catch phrases
 briefly popular in mid-19th-century London. One of them, he observes,
 ""like a mushroom, seems to have sprung up in the night, or, like a frog in
 Cheapside, to have come down in a sudden shower. One day it was unheard,
 unknown, uninvented; the next it pervaded London.""
 
 Was ""like a frog in Cheapside"" (or something similar) a catch phrase
 itself, or did Mackay come up with the simile on his own?
 
 And to what event or events does it refer?
 
 I didn't find anything relevant in Partridge's *A Dictionary of Catch
 Phrases.*

 Trying to shoutdown a speaker or being loud and rowdy while someone else is
 trying to speak (in the vernacular, 'getting in their face') is rude and
 disrespectful.  And persistently getting in someones face is assault, a
 criminal offense. If these people have something to say, they can say it
 with signs or get their own venue.  And here is something else to chew on...
 these protesters are NOT interested in changing anyones mind about what
 Rumsfield is saying. How likely are you to change someone's mind by being
 rude and disrespectful to them? Is this how to win friends and influence
 people? Either these folks are social misfits who have no understanding of
 human interactions (else they would try more constructive means to get their
 message across) or they are just out to get their rocks off regardless of
 how it affects other people, and that is immoral at best and downright evil
 at worst.

 A flaw found in newer versions of the PHP Web server scripting language could allow attackers to crash, and in some cases control, computers over the Internet, an open-source developer group announced Monday.
 The vulnerability affects versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 of PHP, according to the PHP Group. The flaw compromises different computer architectures in different ways: Web servers running on Intel IA-32 hardware could crash, while other systems, including Sun Microsystems' Solaris, could allow the attacker to infiltrate the computer.

 <a name=""h3""><b>CollabNet takes wing for online games</b></a><br>
 <font size=""-1"">
 Software development site CollabNet announced Monday that it is working with Butterfly.net, an IBM-backed effort to create a supercomputing grid for hosting online games.
 CollabNet will host the Butterfly Lab, an online environment that will allow developers to test games using a service modeled on the Butterfly approach. Butterfly will also use CollabBet's SourceCast Web application to enable game development teams to share source code, manage art assets and design games for the Butterfly service.

 <a name=""h4""><b>Russian firm points out new Adobe flaw</b></a><br>
 <font size=""-1"">
 Thumbing its nose at the company that landed one of its employees in jail, ElcomSoft is pointing out new flaws in Adobe Systems' eBook software.
 The flaws could allow someone to check out every copy of every book in Adobe's new electronic library for an unlimited amount of time by changing the values in the loan form. However, the bugs were discovered on an Adobe test Web site that demonstrates how the software could be used to set up a lending library--not an actual site that offers books--and ElcomSoft gives information about how to fix the flaws.

 <font size=""-1"">
 British scientists on Monday announced the completion of one of the building blocks for large-scale data sharing over the Grid--a proposed network of computers seen as the 21st century successor to the Internet.
 The project was carried out by scientists from the U.K.'s E-Science Centres and was co-funded by IBM and Oracle. The companies, rival powers in the database market, contributed both funding and the efforts of their own researchers.

 The latest proposal to drive the Taliban and Al Qaeda out of the
 Mountains of Afghanistan is to send in the ASF (Alabama Special
 Forces) Billy Bob, Bubba, Boo, Scooter, Cooter and Junior are being
 sent in with the following information about the Taliban:
 
 1. There is no limit.
 2. The season opened last weekend.
 3. They taste just like chicken.
 4. They hate beer, pickup trucks, country music, and Jesus.
 5. Some are queer.
 6. They don't like barbecue.
 
 And most importantly...
 
 7. They were responsible for Dale Earnhardt's death.
 
 We estimate it should be over in just about two days.

 Well, I'm sure you can recompile those game packages without ALSA anyway.
 Also, note that ALSA 0.9.x has just appeared in Mandrake 9.0 and that all
 previous Mandrake releases were using the incompatible, aging and now
 unsupported 0.5.x series. (unless I've misunderstood)

 Near to none, it should be quite straightforward :
 http://freshrpms.net/docs/alsa/
 
 The only tricky part is editing the /etc/modules.conf file, but the ALSA
 Soundcard Matrix has a page for every supported card with a section you can
 most of the time simply copy and paste!
 
 I really think that with my ALSA packages, ALSA on Red Hat Linux has never
 been so easy! ;-)
 
 Cheers,
 Matthias

 So thats the trick, just let any anecdotal utterances you LIKE be deemed

 standard...
 
 Yeah, I see how that could be a handy tool RH.

 Well, when studying engineering the rule of thumb was that infinity was 10
 times bigger then the most you could expect to use.
 
 Therefore I believe in infinite stack.
 
 But I do not feel I am a compiler risk either. So where does this leave me?
